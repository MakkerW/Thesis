Hello, good morning everyone, and welcome to our first semester results conference call. As usual, besides myself and the Investor Relations team, we have on the call today, Leo Meira from the Finance team, Paul Timonich from Vorten, Hugo Martins from Sonai Fashion, Luis Matos de Larsson from Sonai Fiera, and Cristiano Neves from Sonai Investment Management. I will start by presenting an overview of our results in the first half of the year, and at the end, as usual, we will have time for Q&A. So, as you all know, 2021 continues to be marked by severe restrictions to all our businesses across the geography, in spite of the progress in the vaccination plan around the world. In Portugal, in particular, we had another lockdown from mid-January until mid-April, and since then we have witnessed a gradual easing of the restrictions, but still with significant limitations, both in terms of store capacity and also opening hours. In total, we had 11 weeks of lockdown this year versus 7 weeks of lockdown last year. Given these sets, our businesses displayed a very positive reaction, and we are very proud of our operational results this year. Just before diving into the results, a quick look on Portugal management. As you know, these last six months have been important in a number of fronts in terms of capital allocation. I would like to highlight the restructuring of our operations in Porto Spain, the increase of our stake in Sonai Fiera, the launch of a partnership between Sonai F and Banco de Stipide, and obviously the ability also shown by Sonai IM to continue to invest in high-growth tech companies and crystallize value in the right moment. And also the agreement reached by Sonai IM to sell a 50% stake in MaxMath for 65 million euros, with an estimated capital gain of 40 million euros. The completion of this deal is expected in Q3. So, let's go into the results. I will do this business by business as usual, and then I will talk about the consolidated results for the semester. Starting with Sonai IM. Sonai IM had a tough comparable, as last year our food format benefited from the first full lockdown in Portugal, that implied a shutdown of restaurants. And consequently, a significant retail support in the market last year. Nevertheless, total turnover increased 4% year-on-year in Q2, with a resilient performance of food formats and with other brands such as Edmell and Wells benefiting from the recovery from last year's difficult period in terms of restrictions. In the first half of the year, turnover amounted to 2.5 billion euros, a 5.4 year-on-year growth and a like-for-like increase of 2.3%, a quite solid performance across different banners. And once again, Sonai IM was able to strengthen its leadership position, with a market share increase in the period. A quick note to Sonai IM's online channel that registered high growth rates in the first half of the year, around 45%, having also grown in Q2 despite the abnormal peak of demand levels in the same period of 2020. Regarding profitability, underlying EBITDA in the first half of 2021 improved by 7.3% year-on-year to 235 million euros, representing a margin of 9.4%, 17 basis points above last year. This is a result of a strong turnover growth and also a sustained operational profitability profile diluting the extra COVID-19 directly related costs. In terms of store expansion, Sonai IM continued to open stores in its proximity formats, with new Bombier stores, a total of 16 Bombier stores up to June, and launched the first cashless store offered by a European retailer, which is called Pompilante Lab. And pre-taxable, we're given 156 million euros over the last 12 months, leading net debt to 654 million euros at the end of June, only 60 million euros above last year's figure, mainly impacted by the dividend payment of 140 million euros in Q2 and implying a total net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.3 times. Moving on to Vorten. At Vorten, the dynamics were quite similar to Sonai IM, with the Portuguese operation decelerating growth after the strong performance achieved during last year's lockdown. In Spain, obviously total turnover decreased as a result of the downsizing of operations in mainland Spain, but the evolution on a pro forma basis was quite positive. Overall, Vorten delivered a very strong sales performance in Q2, reaching 246 million euros, more than 4% growth versus 2019 and almost in line with 2020, obviously with the latter benefiting from extraordinary sales resulting from the first and most stringent confinement period of last year. On a like-for-like basis, Vorten posted a sound growth of 1.5% in Q2, with positive performances from both the online and offline operations, including also the marketplace and services operations. In year-to-date terms, total turnover increased 7.5% year-on-year, with a like-for-like of 14.4%, reaching 518 million euros. We further reinforced our market share and consolidated our leadership position in Portugal. This positive top-line performance and also the restructuring profits in Spain contributed to an improved underlying ETEA that reached 31 million euros at the end of H1, with a margin of 6%, growing 1.9 percentage points versus 2020. At Sanai Fashion, Q2 was a quarter of clear recovery, following the losses experienced during last year's lockdown. Total turnover increased 41% and was practically in line with 2019, a year without any restrictions, obviously in terms of pandemic. Sanai Fashion proved once again to be a solid performer in a challenging context, gaining market share in its key market. In year-to-date terms, Sanai Fashion's performance is also encouraging, as top-line stood at 135 million euros, 3.7% above last year, with a like-for-like of 5.1%. And this is sufficiently significant in the first half of the year, as I mentioned before, stores were closed for 11 weeks, which compares to the 7 weeks of full lockdown in 2020. An important highlight for online sales, which continue to deliver high growth rates, and reached 17% of total turnover this semester. Overall, Sanai Fashion was able to solve an improved underlying ETEA both in Q2 and in the first semester, and after a negative Q1, mostly due to the new lockdown in Portugal, underlying ETEA reached 5.4 million euros in Q2 and 1.5 million euros in the first half of the year. Moving on to ISRG. ISRG is having a terrific recovery, already surpassing 2019 performance levels, a clear sign that even under this backdrop, the company's banners have truly unique selling propositions. As you know, we have a planned mismatch this year, so we've installed it to companies' Q1 account, which saw a significant recovery, both regarding last year and the year before, with all the banners presenting an encouraging positive evolution. Once again, the online channel played a critical role, with a threefold increase and more than offsetting a weaker evolution of the offline channel, given the restrictions that we experienced. Overall, the last six months showed a very good performance, both above last year and also 2019 figures. This top-line improvement in the quarter was able to achieve a significant improvement at EBITDA level. This performance implied a much better equity method contribution towards Sanai's results. Apart from the operational performance, I would like to highlight the agreement between ISRG and DePaul Village's founders to acquire an 80% stake in this e-commerce player for 140 million euros. DePaul Village is a well-known online retailer focused on the sale of specialist sports equipment, mainly for fashion, running and outdoor, with sales of 118 million euros and a profit forecast of 7.4 million euros in 2020. Post-completion, the two founders will keep a 20% stake, and they are managing both the CEO and also Chief Purchasing Officer, and this acquisition will enhance ISRG's specialization in key sports categories, while significantly increasing its physical capabilities in the sports e-commerce market and also complementing the ongoing positive developments in its existing banners, namely Sprinter and SportsZone. Also in Q2, ISRG expanded into a new geography by acquiring SUAR, the operator in the Netherlands with the Ferries and Nike banners. This is also an important milestone for the company, an important international expansion move and a clear step towards achieving the vision of being a European leader in sports retail. As for Sonai Fiera, as you all know, 2021 continues to be a challenging year for the shopping center industry, as lockdown restrictions across different countries continue to impact the forum. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight that there have been positive signs of a return to normality every time restrictions are eased, as there continues to be strong consumer demand for quality shopping center destinations. For Sonai Fiera, Q2 was also a quarter of recovery, with encouraging sales performance in Portugal since the reopening of shopping centers in the middle of April and a sustained positive evolution in the remaining European countries. From an operational standpoint and considering year-to-date figures, Sonai Fiera's European portfolio recorded an 11.6% year-on-year increase in sales, a decrease of 12.3% year-on-year in rent, similarized by discounts in Portugal

up in 3% year on year in rank. In the life I did account in Portugal, had not been raised, continued at a very high and stable rate of 97% at the end of H1. Looking at the portfolio management accounts, ICM reported a net loss of 4.6 million euros year to date, with between a positive 11 million euros direct result and a negative 15 million euros of indirect result, mainly due to property valuations in the quarter. In any case, NAG actually increased for the first time in several quarters, up to 911 million euros at the end of June, with a net loss that I mentioned previously being more than offset by a positive FX impact in Brazil. For Sonae Financial Services, the second quarter was marked by the launch of the partnership with Banco Piquet, as I mentioned before, and the implementation of a new business model for the Universal Card. Due to this business model change, and as the credit stack was only started being generated in December 2020, the company's turnover naturally showed a discontinuity that will be mitigated in the coming months with the growth of the credit stack. Nevertheless, in operational terms and with regards to the Universal Market Share, it stood at 15% at the end of May, the latest date that we have, which compares to 14.8% last year. The company also continued its strong efforts to expand its physical footprint, surpassing already 500,000 customers, digital customers at the end of June, a 39,000 customer increase when compared to the end of March. Regarding MBS, the insurance brokerage company, it continues to show a strong commercial performance across all channels and geographies, and this resulted in very strong growth, which is high single-digit in Portugal and double-digit in Brazil, and a significant improvement in operating profitability. Similarly to the first quarter, in proportional terms, considering the 50% consolidation of MBS, Sonae has had sustained to register a year-on-year decrease as a result of both the pandemic context and the business model change that I mentioned before with Banco Piquet. Overall, H1 turnover stood at 30.1 million euros and the line of EDA followed the same trend, reaching a negative 3 million euros in the first half of the year. At Sonae IM, the quarter was marked by the sale of parts of our stake in Article for 36 million euros with a gross capital gain of 12 million euros, and the announcement of the sale together with the other shareholders of BizDirect for just over 12 million euros, which should be concluded in Q3. BizDirect was already considered as an asset held for sale, and therefore it is not considered both in 2021 and in past comparisons. In operational terms, Sonae IM's turnover increased by 11% year-on-year to 29 million euros, benefiting from the performance of the cybersecurity portfolio, and underlying EBITDA also improved compared to last year. In terms of portfolio activities, the company's NTV reached 305 million euros, and apart from the already mentioned activities, Sonae IM entered into the share capital of Portainer.io, one of the most popular container management platforms globally. In addition to this, and also not less relevant, H1 was marked by relevant achievements in some of the minority states that we hold indirectly, mainly through Article, but also through some companies that we saw already viewing on valuations. Regarding Article, the company recently announced a new financing round of 150 million dollars by some of the existing and new investors at a underlying valuation of 4.3 billion dollars. Despite being a relatively small transaction, it's also a good sign of the company's strong evolution and potential. Finally, North. North has already published its results last week, I would say a solid set of results, but the company continued to post solid operational performance in its helpful segment, and the media and entertainment segment was marked by the reopening of cinema theatres on the 19th of April. Turnover amounted to 341 million euros in Q2, a growth of 6.2% year-on-year, the first quarter with growth since the end of 2019, supported by 5% quarter evolution in telco and a nearly 50% growth in the media and entertainment segment, driven by the reopening of cinema theatres. In H1, turnover stood at a total of 607 million euros, or 148% year-on-year increase. Regarding profitability, Q2 EBITDA decreased 2.2% year-on-year due to an increase in direct costs. As last year, these were unusually low due to some extraordinary accounting of COVID costs, and in year-to-date terms, EBITDA stood at 307 million euros, a 1.3% decrease year-on-year. Overall, net income decreased by 2 million euros to 43 million euros in Q2, and more than doubled compared to last year, to 74 million euros in the first half of the year. I will now cover briefly Consolidate's performance, and Consolidate's turnover increased by 5.1% year-on-year to 1.6 billion euros in Q2, mainly anchored on the positive contributions from Financials and Fashion, leading to a 5.5% growth in H1 to 3.2 billion euros. Following this offline trend, in Q2 and the line of EBITDA increased 9.9% year-on-year to 136 million euros, mainly driven by the recovery of Financials and also the impact of the Spanish restructuring process at Bortens. And at the end of the semester, we reached 246 million euros, 11.4% above last year. EBITDA reached 165 million euros in Q2, a significant improvement versus last year, mainly backed by the operational recovery of the businesses harmed by the COVID-19 restrictions last year. Also a higher net result of ISRG when compared to 2020, and the capital gain from the dilution of IEM's stake in the market. This performance led to a total EBITDA in the semester of 292 million euros, a 15.5% increase year-on-year. Overall, direct results increased almost 50 million euros in Q2, to 55 million euros, and more than 17 million euros in the first semester, due to the high level of COVID-19 extra costs and provisions registered back in Q1 of 2020. The direct result was 10 million euros in Q2 this year, positively impacted by IEM's portfolio valuation and the dividends increased. The dividends increased from direct stakes lost on just under 11 million euros, which more than offsets IEM's investment property valuation decrease. All in all, IEM's net results reached 62 million euros, both in Q2 and also in the semester. In terms of operational cash flow, IEM's portfolio released a total of 123 million euros during the last 12 months. These last 12 months saw quite some activity in terms of portfolio management, as we discussed in previous calls. At FONAI, we reinforced its shareholder positions in NOS, SALTA and PRAIERRA for a total consideration of 323 million euros, also including FONAI and its investments in the period. This was partially offset by 109 million of cash flow fees from acquisitions, mainly related with IEM and PRAIERRA's fairly recent acquisitions. But all in all, FONAI's free cash flow for the last 12 months, before dividends paid, stood at a negative 100 million euros, 101 million euros at the end of Q2 this year. Therefore, and after dividends paid, consolidated net debt reached just under 1.5 billion euros, still a conservative level of leverage as FONAI continues to hold a solid capital structure with a comfortable financial position, which includes a low cost of debt of 1.1% and an average maturity profile of 3.6 years and an LTV of 15%. Additionally, if you look at the leverage profiles of our main businesses, they also remain quite solid and prudent across the portfolio. FONAI and T reached, as I mentioned before, 3.3 times total net debt on the LTV ratio. NOS maintained its net financial debt to EBITDA at 1.8 times. And FONAI's care, currently hold a robust value of 24% and has a very strong liquidity position. So overall, we are quite pleased with the results achieved by our portfolio of businesses this year. And these last 18 months have been challenging, but we feel that we are now coming out of this pandemic strong and prepared for the future. That's it for me for now. Thank you everyone for listening. And you can now open the session to Q&A, please. Thank you. Q&A session has now started. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. Our first question is from José Vida from Castiel Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Yes, hi, good morning to all. And congratulations for the release of the results. I have some questions on FINANC. So first on the fact that you are posting quite difficult comps. Last year was a strong period, but still you achieved quite decent last year in Q2. My question is if this level of last year is achieving for slightly positive Q2 for the upcoming quarters. So that's the first question on FINANC. Then the second related to the new business. We've seen FINANC, so this business are recovering fast because last year some of the social clubs. So my question is if these business on a steady state are matching equities to FINANC. And the third question on FINANC is if you think that slightly smart increase over the coming quarters, even if competition seems to be picking up. That would be my question on FINANC. And then I should continue with another on Boston. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you for your questions. I will hand

Okay, great. Thank you for your questions. I will hand it over to Luis to answer the first question. Hi, Luis. I'll answer to the very first question.

There are meaningful synergies that we can extract as good interactions between both teams. So we do not visit the sale of policy in Brazil at this point. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three, two on SunMFC. A follow-up on José's question. This positive life for life that you're seeing in July on the overall portfolio. You are also seeing a positive life for life in supermarkets. The second question is can you elaborate on how the competitive environment has evolved in recent months? And finally, a question on capital allocation. You have been very active in terms of capital allocation. Sold Max Marticalsport in Spain with the spacing in Northern Sierra. What could be the next big move for SunLife? Also knowing that you're going to grow your international presence. If you could tell us in general terms what you're looking for, including if it is in the same sectors you have invested in or in new ones, would be great. Thank you. Thank you, João. Do you want to start with the M&A questions and I'll take the last one at the end? Hi, João. So, very much like last year, we see it off the received. Well, July is looking good. But in last year, it's not as good as last year. The competitive environment, so, very much the time that we were looking at in the last month, there are some players, some players in the last month, but we knew that it happened as the year last. It's going to be difficult to continue in the proximity formats, which is not the case, is being the fact that we are in the proximity and the proximity is being the same as the other European countries. And the last thing I would like to say is that we have a very good performance in the last year, but we have very good performance in the last year. So, I would say that the performance of the economy is not as good as last year, but it's happening today and it will happen in the next 10 years. But what happened in the last year or the last 10 years? The fact that in our case is going to be more unskilled. Yes, very good. So, on the capital allocation questions, I would say that we are quite happy with what we have achieved in the last couple of years in terms of portfolio rearrangement. I think the operations that we've done has better prepared us for the future and also better prepared our businesses. Many of the transactions that we did were critical also to achieve the level of results that we are achieving right now because it's focused on the management team on the right markets, on the right businesses. So, we are quite happy with what we've achieved in terms of what will be the next big move. We will be. We will remain active, looking for opportunities that match our investment criteria. So, ideal opportunities that somehow leverage our existing assets and capabilities, also match our return targets and help us achieve the best possible balance geographically and sector-wise. And we will also remain active and attentive in looking for opportunities to maximize value in our existing assets. As you know, we have a flexible investment strategy. We have companies in which we are part of it. We have companies in which we are 100% shareholders. And so, we will remain on the lookout for opportunities that help us maximize the value of our existing assets. Thank you very much. Thank you, João. Our next question comes from Antonio Salades from AS Independent Research. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Thank you for the presentation. I have two questions, one related with Sierra. The one was called on the traffic on Sierra. If it is evolving as we were expecting or not. So, if you can share with us how it is the traffic on shopping centers. Because I have been talking a lot about online and marketplaces and so on. So, should we be worried about the traffic on shopping centers in these coming features? And the second question is related with our problems on the topic. If there are any news on this subject. Thank you very much. Okay. We are going to start with the Sierra one. We will go for it. Antonio, thank you for your questions. In relation to shopping centers and the recovery of the current dynamics. The best way to think about us, and particularly looking at everything that is in the press, etc. But the best way to think about us is like a factory that currently is not allowed to operate two or three production lines. And we are not allowed to operate them because the health authorities or the governments don't allow us to operate. The machines are in very good form. The raw material is all there. It is just not allowed to turn them on. And that is why when you look at our current performance, it is very difficult to make a judgment on how we can actually operate at full capacity. Having said that, maybe the best month to look for fundamentals is the month of May. The month of May was the first month post lockdown. It was maybe a month only partially impacted by the Delta variant. Nevertheless, it had material restrictions. But when we look at our portfolio in the month of May, sales were down by 12% compared to 2019. 12% were 1-2% at the European level and this was relatively consistent across all geographies. We are also seeing in some centers a performance compared to 2019 and some other centers a bit below. But sales were only down by 12%. 12% might still look like a big number and we would all like it to be much lower. But if you take into account that, one, we have zero tourists right now and tourism is a relevant part of our shopping centers. Two, we still have significant people working from home, meaning less people at the offices. Three, we have the harshest limitations in terms of number of people per square meter in our shopping centers. The harshest limitations in Europe, which means that the shopping experience is not very positive, which means again we are not allowed to utilize full capacities. Four, our timing restrictions are very meaningful. Shopping centers have to close much earlier than they want. Again, a limitation of our full capacities. So if you take all of these limitations into account and you look at minus 12% of sales compared to 2019, I think that is a very, very good number. Furthermore, when we look at June, in June things across Europe maintained the trajectory that we saw in May. Portugal was maybe the only country where things backtracked a bit, again due to the severe restrictions that we witnessed in Portugal. But overall I would say that the recovery is very satisfactory. We are very encouraged by what we see, but bear in mind that we still have a few machines that we are not allowed to switch on. And we are very keen to switch them on. Our finger is on the button and once we can press it, everything indicates that we will return to normality very quickly. We are also monitoring official forecasts from reputable market sources and the return to normality is not something that we say. The return to normality is something that markets, reputable independent resources also confirm will happen in the short term. So lots to do, lots going on, very keen on operating at full speed. We are just not allowed to do that. But we feel that the demand is there and we have fundamental figures to prove that. Just to clarify, minus 12% was on your portfolio, not just in Portugal. It was on your portfolio in Europe, yes? In May, yes. Okay, thank you. That is right, minus 12% across Europe. Okay, thank you. Antonio, on your second question, unfortunately the answer there is no. We don't have any relevant news on the legal proceedings in terms of change of decisions from the court. I think the good news is that the company is functioning well, operating normally. We are obviously monitoring the situation and actively engaging with relevant parties. But we don't have anything to announce as of this day. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you, Antonio. There are no further questions from the participants. If I had a full-time service, I do not. Okay, so if there are no more questions, I would like to thank everyone for listening. I would also like to thank Jose's initial remarks on the many of the programming results. This were the holidays. It was a huge effort on the part of the team. But we are very happy that we were able to achieve this.

and to venture with our Q3 results at this moment in time. So thank you everyone and I would like to wish good holidays for those of you going on holidays and I hope you all remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much and let's talk again when we present our Q3 results later in the year. Thank you.

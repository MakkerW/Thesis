WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.520
things. Nick. Thanks, Inga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap

00:08.520 --> 00:15.120
of our first quarter sales performance. As Inga mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in

00:15.120 --> 00:26.140
the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic

00:26.140 --> 00:33.460
businesses, reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales

00:33.460 --> 00:42.300
by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7%

00:42.300 --> 00:49.660
versus last year. As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across

00:49.660 --> 00:56.780
all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%,

00:56.780 --> 01:04.500
led by mid-single-digit increases in both industrial and safety and graphics. Our electronics and energy

01:04.500 --> 01:11.900
and healthcare businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The consumer business

01:11.900 --> 01:18.180
declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market,

01:18.180 --> 01:25.140
as Inga mentioned. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%.

01:25.140 --> 01:31.300
All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in

01:31.300 --> 01:37.680
electronics and energy. We also had strong growth in industrial, healthcare, and consumer.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.400
Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China, Hong Kong,

01:46.400 --> 01:55.300
and Japan. Excluding our electronics businesses, China-Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%.

01:55.860 --> 02:05.180
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically,

02:05.660 --> 02:12.560
with sales growth led by industrial and safety and graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa

02:12.560 --> 02:22.680
grew nearly 2%. Finally, organic growth in Latin America-Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit

02:22.680 --> 02:29.680
growth in healthcare, along with solid growth in consumer and safety and graphics. At a country level,

02:29.900 --> 02:39.560
Mexico continued to deliver strong growth at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%.

02:39.560 --> 02:47.580
Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales

02:47.580 --> 02:59.540
were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAP operating margins were 23.1%,

02:59.540 --> 03:08.840
down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1. Earlier, you heard Inga mention the additional $136 million

03:08.840 --> 03:16.440
of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and

03:16.440 --> 03:23.000
productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points

03:23.000 --> 03:28.300
year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.480
Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter.

03:34.480 --> 03:42.440
Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins.

03:43.640 --> 03:48.980
Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points.

03:50.180 --> 03:55.760
Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered

03:55.760 --> 03:58.560
savings in excess of market price changes.

03:58.560 --> 04:05.860
We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive

04:05.860 --> 04:07.120
for the full year.

04:08.000 --> 04:14.760
Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points

04:14.760 --> 04:15.360
in the quarter.

04:16.360 --> 04:24.140
As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension

04:24.140 --> 04:28.660
and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year-on-year.

04:29.140 --> 04:36.460
Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.400
Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share.

04:43.280 --> 04:50.020
First quarter, gap earnings increased 5.4% to $2.16 per share.

04:50.020 --> 04:58.420
The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.680
Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.500
The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share.

05:10.580 --> 05:17.840
Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments

05:17.840 --> 05:19.440
were a $0.16 impact.

05:20.020 --> 05:28.100
The first quarter tax rate was 23.7% versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter,

05:28.500 --> 05:31.260
which increased earnings by $0.09 per share.

05:31.920 --> 05:37.040
The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix,

05:37.780 --> 05:41.540
increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation,

05:42.200 --> 05:44.600
and ongoing strategic tax initiatives.

05:44.600 --> 05:55.080
In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%.

05:55.080 --> 06:02.740
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year-on-year,

06:03.140 --> 06:06.020
which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share.

06:06.020 --> 06:10.260
Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.800
We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company,

06:16.100 --> 06:21.980
which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders.

06:21.980 --> 06:30.180
First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year-on-year,

06:30.620 --> 06:33.660
largely due to the timing of pension contributions.

06:34.720 --> 06:42.000
Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 to $500 million,

06:42.000 --> 06:44.140
similar to 2016.

06:45.180 --> 06:49.460
Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year,

06:49.460 --> 06:56.460
we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%.

06:56.460 --> 07:01.680
Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.880
First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million,

07:07.520 --> 07:10.560
in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.

07:10.560 --> 07:18.360
For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 to $1.5 billion.

07:19.160 --> 07:25.320
As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%,

07:25.320 --> 07:31.740
resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter.

07:32.460 --> 07:38.220
We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases.

07:38.220 --> 07:44.840
We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 to $4.5 billion.

07:46.560 --> 07:52.340
Let's now review our performance by business group, starting with Industrial on slide 11.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.860
Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4,

07:57.860 --> 08:05.640
delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically.

08:06.700 --> 08:11.620
Industrial's growth was broad-based across all businesses and geographic areas.

08:12.620 --> 08:17.860
Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial,

08:18.660 --> 08:20.720
increasing double digits organically.

08:20.720 --> 08:27.900
Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.360
Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits.

08:33.920 --> 08:40.540
Our heartlanded businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes,

08:40.940 --> 08:45.640
and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically.

08:45.640 --> 08:52.240
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits,

08:52.820 --> 08:56.540
while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits.

08:57.500 --> 09:02.180
Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million,

09:02.920 --> 09:05.640
with operating margins of 23.1%.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.360
Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-on-year,

09:10.360 --> 09:16.640
or up 40 basis points, adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.820
As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017.

09:22.820 --> 09:28.280
For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%,

09:28.280 --> 09:31.360
versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%.

09:32.060 --> 09:34.660
Please turn to slide 12.

09:34.660 --> 09:42.720
First quarter sales and safety and graphics were up 4.8% organically, to $1.5 billion.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.820
Personal safety, another heartland business,

09:47.140 --> 09:50.560
delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits,

09:50.780 --> 09:54.300
with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S.

09:55.080 --> 09:59.320
The Rook and Granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter,

09:59.320 --> 10:05.680
posting double-digit organic growth as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.080
Geographically, safety and graphics grew organically in all areas,

10:11.560 --> 10:16.900
led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S.

10:18.340 --> 10:22.160
Operating income for the business group was $399 million,

10:22.160 --> 10:28.960
and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%.

10:28.960 --> 10:35.020
Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last,

10:35.260 --> 10:37.960
operating margins were up 80 basis points.

10:38.820 --> 10:42.840
As with Industrial, safety and graphics is off to a strong start,

10:43.320 --> 10:46.500
and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year.

10:46.500 --> 10:52.500
We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5%,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.740
versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%.

10:55.740 --> 10:59.140
Please turn to slide 13.

11:00.820 --> 11:05.140
Our healthcare business generated first-quarter sales of $1.4 billion.

11:06.340 --> 11:09.520
Organic growth was 3.1% year-on-year,

11:09.960 --> 11:13.960
in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%.

11:13.960 --> 11:20.080
Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety.

11:21.160 --> 11:23.020
Our medical consumables businesses,

11:23.400 --> 11:26.020
which represent the largest segment within healthcare,

11:26.500 --> 11:28.160
posted good growth in Q1.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.660
Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter,

11:33.660 --> 11:37.060
a marked improvement from the second half of 2016.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.720
Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically.

11:42.720 --> 11:46.060
We expect the business to improve throughout the year.

11:47.680 --> 11:52.100
Geographically, organic growth in healthcare was positive in all areas,

11:52.680 --> 11:57.080
led by high single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada, and Asia Pacific.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.500
We saw notable strength in China-Hong Kong,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.640
which was up double digits in the quarter.

12:03.900 --> 12:07.540
Healthcare's operating income was $434 million,

12:07.540 --> 12:11.620
and margins remained strong at 30.5%.

12:11.620 --> 12:14.920
Importantly, we generated these returns

12:14.920 --> 12:17.380
while investing an additional $21 million

12:17.380 --> 12:21.800
to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.100
Please turn to slide 14.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.660
Electronics and energy led our company

12:28.660 --> 12:32.340
with organic growth of 11.5% in the first quarter.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.760
Sales were $1.2 billion.

12:34.760 --> 12:39.840
The electronic side of the business grew 18% organically,

12:40.180 --> 12:43.260
as our team successfully drove increased penetration

12:43.260 --> 12:45.500
on a number of OEM platforms.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.120
Demand strengthened across most market segments

12:49.120 --> 12:50.380
in consumer electronics,

12:50.720 --> 12:53.160
which also boosted our growth rate,

12:53.420 --> 12:56.500
and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps.

12:57.320 --> 13:01.120
Our energy-related businesses were up 1% organically,

13:01.120 --> 13:04.720
with low single-digit growth in electrical markets,

13:05.300 --> 13:06.480
while telecom was flat.

13:07.300 --> 13:08.820
On a geographic basis,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.360
organic growth was up double digits in Asia Pacific,

13:12.540 --> 13:15.140
where our electronics business is concentrated.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.540
First quarter operating income for electronics and energy

13:19.540 --> 13:21.240
was $225 million,

13:21.960 --> 13:24.620
with margins of 18.6%,

13:24.620 --> 13:26.520
up 70 basis points.

13:26.520 --> 13:30.340
Adjusting for first quarter portfolio actions,

13:30.820 --> 13:32.800
margins were nearly 24%,

13:32.800 --> 13:35.400
up 600 basis points year-on-year.

13:36.060 --> 13:37.300
As you can see,

13:37.480 --> 13:39.900
Q1 organic growth was very robust

13:39.900 --> 13:41.360
for electronics and energy.

13:42.000 --> 13:42.720
As a result,

13:43.120 --> 13:45.940
we are updating our full-year growth expectations

13:45.940 --> 13:47.060
for this business

13:47.060 --> 13:50.220
to a range of up 1% to 6%,

13:50.220 --> 13:54.480
versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.560
The first half of the year

13:56.560 --> 13:59.120
is expected to be stronger than the second half,

13:59.640 --> 14:01.900
largely driven by year-on-year comps.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.580
Please turn to slide 15.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.180
First quarter sales and consumer were $1 billion,

14:09.840 --> 14:13.340
and organic growth declined 1.2% year-on-year.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.680
Three of our four businesses within consumer

14:16.680 --> 14:17.900
grew organically,

14:18.540 --> 14:20.100
again led by home improvement,

14:20.420 --> 14:22.900
followed by consumer health care and home care.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.840
Within the home improvement business,

14:26.260 --> 14:28.760
our command damage-free mounting products

14:28.760 --> 14:30.940
posted strong double-digit growth

14:30.940 --> 14:34.220
as accelerated investments continued to pay off.

14:35.100 --> 14:38.220
Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter.

14:39.360 --> 14:41.220
More than offsetting this growth

14:41.220 --> 14:42.820
was a year-on-year decline

14:42.820 --> 14:45.560
in our stationary and office supplies business,

14:46.060 --> 14:49.720
which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions,

14:49.720 --> 14:53.760
primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.400
Geographically,

14:57.520 --> 14:58.800
organic growth in consumer

14:58.800 --> 15:01.920
was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America Canada,

15:02.260 --> 15:05.000
which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.080
Operating income was $222 million,

15:09.760 --> 15:12.720
with operating margins of 21.3%.

15:12.720 --> 15:15.580
Looking at the full year,

15:16.180 --> 15:18.440
we expect organic growth for consumer

15:18.440 --> 15:20.860
to be in the range of 1% to 3%

15:20.860 --> 15:24.340
versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.220
We also expect to see growth improve

15:27.220 --> 15:28.400
as the year progresses.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.180
Please turn to slide 16.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.620
Before I turn it back to Inga,

15:34.720 --> 15:36.700
let me address a few items

15:36.700 --> 15:38.180
that we anticipate will happen

15:38.180 --> 15:39.960
over the remainder of 2017.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.800
The net impact of these items

15:42.800 --> 15:45.400
is factored into our EPS guidance today.

15:46.460 --> 15:48.000
First, as you may recall,

15:48.140 --> 15:48.720
in December,

15:48.980 --> 15:50.340
we announced the divestiture

15:50.340 --> 15:52.540
of our identity management business

15:52.540 --> 15:54.120
within Safety and Graphics.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.520
The sale of this business,

15:57.040 --> 15:58.440
which has annual sales

15:58.440 --> 16:00.380
of approximately $205 million,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.680
is expected to close

16:02.680 --> 16:03.920
during the second quarter.

16:04.940 --> 16:05.980
Upon completion,

16:06.660 --> 16:08.420
we expect to record a gain

16:08.420 --> 16:11.600
on sale of approximately $0.55 per share,

16:12.500 --> 16:14.180
partially offset by the profit

16:14.180 --> 16:16.440
that will go with the business in 2017

16:16.440 --> 16:18.980
after the divestiture is closed.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.580
In addition,

16:21.520 --> 16:23.120
recall at our investor meeting

16:23.120 --> 16:24.580
in March of 2016,

16:25.260 --> 16:26.840
we introduced a plan

16:26.840 --> 16:28.860
to better optimize our portfolio

16:28.860 --> 16:30.560
and supply chain footprint.

16:31.100 --> 16:33.780
We expect to make significant progress

16:33.780 --> 16:35.520
on that plan in 2017

16:35.520 --> 16:38.000
with associated costs

16:38.000 --> 16:40.980
in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share

16:40.980 --> 16:42.960
over the remainder of the year.

16:43.960 --> 16:47.740
We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share

16:47.740 --> 16:49.680
will incur in Q2.

16:50.620 --> 16:51.580
In total,

16:52.060 --> 16:53.760
the net impact of these items

16:53.760 --> 16:55.120
is expected to add

16:55.120 --> 16:56.620
between $0.05 and $0.10

16:56.620 --> 16:59.140
to 2017 earnings per share.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.060
Again,

17:00.660 --> 17:02.160
this impact is reflected

17:02.160 --> 17:04.500
in our full year updated guidance,

17:05.100 --> 17:06.360
which Inga will now cover

17:06.360 --> 17:07.540
on slide 17.

17:08.580 --> 17:09.000
Inga?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.180
To acknowledge your request.

17:11.820 --> 17:12.300
Yeah, Andy,

17:12.360 --> 17:13.240
thanks for the question.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.120
You covered quite a few things there.

17:15.780 --> 17:18.120
Just from an overall theme standpoint,

17:18.460 --> 17:18.660
Andy,

17:18.780 --> 17:20.740
we're always looking for opportunities

17:20.740 --> 17:22.560
to enhance the value of the enterprise,

17:22.700 --> 17:23.640
and that's really part

17:23.640 --> 17:24.640
of our business model.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.320
What you see in the first quarter

17:28.320 --> 17:30.900
for incremental investments,

17:31.600 --> 17:33.460
some of that was investments

17:33.460 --> 17:36.600
we were taking to accelerate growth,

17:36.720 --> 17:38.080
and that was really lined up

17:38.080 --> 17:39.820
with what we had shared last December

17:39.820 --> 17:42.120
of the incremental $100 million

17:42.120 --> 17:44.040
over the course of 2017

17:44.040 --> 17:46.060
to deliver accelerated growth

17:46.060 --> 17:47.620
throughout the year.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.440
The other context I'd share with you

17:51.440 --> 17:53.060
in thinking about this step-up

17:53.060 --> 17:55.020
in strategic investments.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.600
If you think back to last March

17:57.600 --> 17:58.720
at our investor meeting

17:58.720 --> 17:59.780
when we laid out

17:59.780 --> 18:01.540
our five-year plan,

18:02.220 --> 18:03.640
we shared plans

18:03.640 --> 18:06.340
for optimizing our portfolio

18:06.340 --> 18:07.620
and supply chain footprint

18:07.620 --> 18:09.440
with, at that time,

18:09.500 --> 18:10.280
what we described,

18:10.420 --> 18:12.060
a total of between

18:12.060 --> 18:13.920
$500 and $600 million

18:13.920 --> 18:15.420
of investments,

18:15.420 --> 18:16.900
and ultimately

18:16.900 --> 18:19.560
that we expected that

18:19.560 --> 18:20.440
by 2020

18:20.440 --> 18:21.300
to be creating

18:21.300 --> 18:24.500
$125 to $175 million

18:24.500 --> 18:26.180
of annualized benefit,

18:26.480 --> 18:27.740
operating income benefit.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.320
What you're seeing

18:29.320 --> 18:30.340
in this step-up

18:30.340 --> 18:33.440
of accelerated strategic investments,

18:33.600 --> 18:34.820
both for the quarter

18:34.820 --> 18:36.220
and for the year,

18:37.000 --> 18:40.240
is us taking more action

18:40.240 --> 18:41.220
related to that,

18:41.960 --> 18:43.780
what we laid out last year

18:43.780 --> 18:45.720
for the optimized actions

18:45.720 --> 18:47.360
on our supply chain footprint.

18:47.980 --> 18:48.560
Yeah, Joe,

18:48.700 --> 18:50.780
as the quarter went on,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.040
it was consistent strength

18:53.040 --> 18:54.240
across the quarter,

18:54.440 --> 18:55.340
all three months

18:55.340 --> 18:55.940
of the quarter.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.860
And I'd further add,

18:58.940 --> 18:59.940
we're seeing April,

19:00.180 --> 19:01.020
the start of April,

19:01.240 --> 19:03.240
tracking very much in line

19:03.240 --> 19:04.400
with what we've been seeing

19:04.400 --> 19:06.700
for the first quarter.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.900
So, really no

19:08.900 --> 19:10.260
inter-quarter

19:10.260 --> 19:11.980
trend changes.

19:12.380 --> 19:12.920
Yeah, Julian,

19:13.100 --> 19:15.980
we're not fundamentally

19:15.980 --> 19:17.120
seeing any change

19:17.120 --> 19:18.200
in our pricing power.

19:18.360 --> 19:19.660
That remains strong.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.040
We do continue

19:21.040 --> 19:22.900
to look for targeted places

19:22.900 --> 19:23.660
where we can

19:23.660 --> 19:25.320
use price

19:25.320 --> 19:27.160
to help drive

19:27.160 --> 19:28.520
organic volume growth.

19:29.120 --> 19:30.160
If I look out

19:30.160 --> 19:32.000
over total 2017,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.720
we're still,

19:34.020 --> 19:35.300
we're expecting

19:35.300 --> 19:37.860
U.S. price growth

19:37.860 --> 19:39.340
to be approximately flat.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.580
If I expand it

19:40.580 --> 19:41.720
to the total globe,

19:42.760 --> 19:44.480
if I pull out

19:44.480 --> 19:45.380
the FX impact,

19:45.540 --> 19:46.400
we expect pricing

19:46.400 --> 19:47.700
to be up slightly.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.260
Our normal range

19:49.260 --> 19:51.080
is 30 to 50 basis points

19:51.080 --> 19:52.160
of core price growth.

19:52.820 --> 19:53.540
I think it'll be

19:53.540 --> 19:54.680
somewhere between there

19:54.680 --> 19:55.400
and flat

19:55.400 --> 19:56.900
for total 2017.

19:56.900 --> 20:00.380
Yeah,

20:00.560 --> 20:02.660
the $136 million

20:02.660 --> 20:04.920
in strategic investments

20:04.920 --> 20:05.920
in the first quarter,

20:06.100 --> 20:06.400
Julian,

20:06.980 --> 20:08.280
a little less

20:08.280 --> 20:09.260
than half of that

20:09.260 --> 20:11.340
is investments

20:11.340 --> 20:12.120
that we see

20:12.120 --> 20:13.680
having a fairly

20:13.680 --> 20:14.920
short-term return

20:14.920 --> 20:16.340
in 2017

20:16.340 --> 20:16.840
and then

20:16.840 --> 20:18.160
into early 2018.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.100
And those are

20:20.100 --> 20:21.720
primarily growth-oriented

20:21.720 --> 20:22.640
investments

20:22.640 --> 20:24.660
and those growth-oriented

20:24.660 --> 20:25.400
investments

20:25.400 --> 20:26.080
were factored

20:26.080 --> 20:26.900
into the guidance

20:26.900 --> 20:27.520
we set out

20:27.520 --> 20:28.440
for the year.

20:28.860 --> 20:29.660
The remainder

20:29.660 --> 20:31.800
of the strategic investments,

20:32.360 --> 20:33.180
those relate

20:33.180 --> 20:35.180
to our portfolio,

20:35.660 --> 20:36.740
supply chain footprint,

20:37.360 --> 20:37.960
and that's really

20:37.960 --> 20:38.860
laid out,

20:39.240 --> 20:40.120
aligned closely

20:40.120 --> 20:40.760
with the plan

20:40.760 --> 20:41.820
that we put forward.

20:44.120 --> 20:44.480
Yeah,

20:44.620 --> 20:45.100
so when we,

20:45.360 --> 20:46.280
in December

20:46.280 --> 20:47.080
when we laid out

20:47.080 --> 20:48.080
our guidance,

20:48.520 --> 20:49.340
EPS guidance

20:49.340 --> 20:50.060
for the year,

20:50.620 --> 20:51.660
strategic investments

20:51.660 --> 20:52.300
we had

20:52.300 --> 20:53.760
incrementally

20:53.760 --> 20:55.780
in a 5 to 10 cent range.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.340
that was aligned

20:57.340 --> 20:58.180
primarily

20:58.180 --> 20:59.360
or almost exclusively

20:59.360 --> 21:00.220
with our

21:00.220 --> 21:01.700
growth investments.

21:02.580 --> 21:03.660
Now what you're seeing,

21:04.040 --> 21:05.180
we're seeing the growth

21:05.180 --> 21:06.200
investments play out

21:06.200 --> 21:07.580
exactly as we guided,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.800
still in that 5 to 10 cent range

21:09.800 --> 21:10.660
for the total year.

21:11.160 --> 21:12.000
What we're layering

21:12.000 --> 21:13.100
on top of that

21:13.100 --> 21:15.760
is additional footprint

21:15.760 --> 21:16.880
actions that were,

21:17.160 --> 21:18.400
and portfolio actions

21:18.400 --> 21:19.020
that were taken

21:19.020 --> 21:21.140
throughout 2017.

21:22.140 --> 21:23.480
So on top

21:23.480 --> 21:24.560
of the growth investments,

21:24.700 --> 21:25.160
there's roughly

21:25.160 --> 21:26.020
an incremental

21:26.020 --> 21:26.760
10 cents

21:26.760 --> 21:27.760
of supply chain

21:27.760 --> 21:29.300
and portfolio actions

21:29.300 --> 21:29.940
that we took

21:29.940 --> 21:31.340
in the first quarter

21:31.340 --> 21:32.480
of 2017.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.020
And then in terms

21:34.020 --> 21:34.800
of the guidance

21:34.800 --> 21:35.820
for the bounce

21:35.820 --> 21:36.640
of this year,

21:37.400 --> 21:38.380
for Q2,

21:38.560 --> 21:38.780
3,

21:38.840 --> 21:39.200
and 4,

21:39.300 --> 21:40.020
there's an extra

21:40.020 --> 21:42.200
40 to 45 cents

21:42.200 --> 21:43.180
on top of that

21:43.180 --> 21:44.400
that was not part

21:44.400 --> 21:45.720
of our initial guidance.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.320
So all in,

21:48.040 --> 21:49.980
the growth investments,

21:50.200 --> 21:50.920
the incremental

21:50.920 --> 21:52.520
10 that we took

21:52.520 --> 21:53.400
in the first quarter

21:53.400 --> 21:54.600
plus what we're expecting

21:54.600 --> 21:56.780
Q2 through Q4,

21:57.180 --> 21:58.160
it's now in the range

21:58.160 --> 22:00.400
of 55 to 65 cents

22:00.400 --> 22:01.240
for the total year.

22:01.360 --> 22:01.760
Nigel,

22:01.820 --> 22:02.440
we're always,

22:02.820 --> 22:03.620
as I said earlier,

22:03.720 --> 22:04.420
we're always looking

22:04.420 --> 22:05.400
for opportunities.

22:06.780 --> 22:07.740
The level

22:07.740 --> 22:08.820
that we were investing

22:08.820 --> 22:09.560
in Q1

22:09.560 --> 22:10.760
in strategic investments

22:10.760 --> 22:11.580
around growth,

22:11.960 --> 22:13.200
no pull forward there.

22:13.320 --> 22:13.960
That's coming

22:13.960 --> 22:15.560
exactly as we had planned.

22:16.240 --> 22:17.320
The increased

22:17.320 --> 22:18.560
strategic investments

22:18.560 --> 22:20.120
around portfolio actions

22:20.120 --> 22:21.880
and supply chain footprint,

22:22.880 --> 22:25.040
that's aligned

22:25.040 --> 22:26.560
with our longer term vision.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.220
The exact timing

22:28.220 --> 22:28.900
of when we were

22:28.900 --> 22:29.920
going to do that,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.200
we did not have clarity

22:32.200 --> 22:33.800
on until we started

22:33.800 --> 22:34.580
pulling the trigger

22:34.580 --> 22:35.760
on some of those actions

22:35.760 --> 22:36.700
in the first quarter

22:36.700 --> 22:38.280
and some that we expect

22:38.280 --> 22:39.000
to have happen

22:39.000 --> 22:40.200
over the next three quarters.

22:40.760 --> 22:41.600
So I'm not sure

22:41.600 --> 22:42.700
I'd characterize it

22:42.700 --> 22:44.880
as a pull forward

22:44.880 --> 22:46.800
as much as it would be.

22:46.920 --> 22:47.780
Now is the time

22:47.780 --> 22:48.780
that it looked like

22:48.780 --> 22:49.380
the right time

22:49.380 --> 22:50.180
for us to pull

22:50.180 --> 22:51.720
the trigger on actions

22:51.720 --> 22:53.160
that we had laid out

22:53.160 --> 22:54.960
last March.

22:55.100 --> 22:55.340
No,

22:55.480 --> 22:57.480
the 40 to 45 cents

22:57.480 --> 22:58.620
does not include

22:58.620 --> 23:00.900
anything for Scott Safety.

23:01.320 --> 23:01.920
At the time

23:01.920 --> 23:03.380
that closes,

23:03.820 --> 23:05.920
we will update guidance

23:05.920 --> 23:07.040
to take into account

23:07.040 --> 23:08.780
any impact

23:08.780 --> 23:09.440
that we'll have

23:09.440 --> 23:10.860
on our 2017 earnings.

23:10.860 --> 23:12.640
In our industrial channel,

23:13.100 --> 23:14.100
we are seeing

23:14.100 --> 23:15.400
increased confidence

23:15.400 --> 23:16.920
in the channel,

23:17.060 --> 23:18.040
which we are seeing,

23:19.700 --> 23:20.300
while we're seeing

23:20.300 --> 23:21.600
good sellouts

23:21.600 --> 23:22.200
of our product,

23:22.320 --> 23:22.680
we're seeing

23:22.680 --> 23:25.260
even stronger sell

23:25.260 --> 23:28.040
into the industrial channel,

23:28.160 --> 23:29.440
primarily in the U.S.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.980
So that is one place

23:30.980 --> 23:32.000
where we're attributing

23:32.000 --> 23:33.180
it to higher confidence

23:33.180 --> 23:34.280
amongst that channel

23:34.280 --> 23:35.620
and seeing what appears

23:35.620 --> 23:36.820
to be some restocking

23:36.820 --> 23:39.120
of depleted channel levels

23:39.120 --> 23:39.660
that we've seen

23:39.660 --> 23:40.280
in the past.

23:41.860 --> 23:42.380
Jeff,

23:42.460 --> 23:43.580
to your first question

23:43.580 --> 23:45.560
on the tax rate

23:45.560 --> 23:47.520
for what we're now seeing

23:47.520 --> 23:49.160
for total 2017,

23:49.980 --> 23:51.400
there's a few dynamics

23:51.400 --> 23:51.980
going on.

23:52.120 --> 23:52.900
First of all,

23:53.920 --> 23:54.920
we are seeing

23:54.920 --> 23:56.220
a favorable

23:56.220 --> 23:58.480
geographic profit mix

23:58.480 --> 23:59.040
for us

23:59.040 --> 24:00.480
that is helping us

24:00.480 --> 24:01.620
in our tax rate.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.560
It's been a headwind

24:02.560 --> 24:03.460
for us the last

24:03.460 --> 24:04.660
couple of years,

24:04.760 --> 24:05.660
and that's switching over

24:05.660 --> 24:06.480
to a tailwind

24:06.480 --> 24:07.440
for us this year.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.760
We're also seeing

24:08.760 --> 24:09.720
some of the benefits

24:09.720 --> 24:11.740
as you'd expect

24:11.740 --> 24:12.860
from some of our

24:12.860 --> 24:14.040
tax planning,

24:14.740 --> 24:16.700
but one of the more

24:16.700 --> 24:17.640
significant items

24:17.640 --> 24:18.960
just in the first quarter

24:18.960 --> 24:20.220
is the benefit

24:20.220 --> 24:20.760
we're getting

24:20.760 --> 24:22.920
from the accounting

24:22.920 --> 24:24.200
standard change

24:24.200 --> 24:26.580
that came into effect

24:26.580 --> 24:27.400
last year

24:27.400 --> 24:30.260
for the excess tax benefits

24:30.260 --> 24:32.300
from stock-based compensation.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.480
from a year-on-year basis,

24:34.480 --> 24:35.060
that's about

24:35.060 --> 24:36.760
a four-cent benefit

24:36.760 --> 24:37.900
versus what we had

24:37.900 --> 24:39.180
a year ago.

24:40.140 --> 24:40.420
And,

24:40.540 --> 24:41.280
Jeff,

24:41.340 --> 24:41.980
I'd say that's

24:41.980 --> 24:42.720
the wild card.

24:42.860 --> 24:43.400
Other things

24:43.400 --> 24:43.940
are going

24:43.940 --> 24:45.980
very much

24:45.980 --> 24:46.960
as we had planned

24:46.960 --> 24:47.700
to get to the

24:47.700 --> 24:49.320
27% tax rate

24:49.320 --> 24:50.780
by 2020,

24:51.400 --> 24:52.880
but with the

24:52.880 --> 24:54.500
added variability

24:54.500 --> 24:55.540
from what happens

24:55.540 --> 24:56.640
with this excess

24:56.640 --> 24:57.860
tax benefit

24:57.860 --> 24:58.680
from stock-based

24:58.680 --> 24:59.400
compensation,

24:59.400 --> 25:00.320
there'll be

25:00.320 --> 25:00.920
some quarters

25:00.920 --> 25:02.080
that's a benefit

25:02.080 --> 25:02.820
and some quarters

25:02.820 --> 25:03.380
we won't see

25:03.380 --> 25:04.460
any benefit at all.

25:05.200 --> 25:05.840
All in,

25:06.320 --> 25:07.400
we're well on track

25:07.400 --> 25:08.340
for hitting

25:08.340 --> 25:09.500
the 27%

25:09.500 --> 25:11.680
in 2020,

25:12.240 --> 25:13.180
possibly even

25:13.180 --> 25:14.000
lower than that,

25:14.100 --> 25:15.260
but when we have

25:15.260 --> 25:16.000
better clarity

25:16.000 --> 25:16.480
on that,

25:16.580 --> 25:17.960
we'll give a revised

25:17.960 --> 25:18.780
number of

25:18.780 --> 25:19.760
can that go

25:19.760 --> 25:20.340
even lower

25:20.340 --> 25:21.400
than the 27%.

25:21.400 --> 25:25.000
To the

25:25.000 --> 25:26.140
second point

25:26.140 --> 25:26.560
on the

25:26.560 --> 25:27.160
strategic

25:27.160 --> 25:28.100
investments,

25:28.240 --> 25:29.680
the $136 million,

25:30.800 --> 25:33.060
of the growth-related

25:33.060 --> 25:33.880
investments,

25:34.520 --> 25:35.060
you're correct,

25:35.160 --> 25:35.720
health care

25:35.720 --> 25:37.340
had the

25:37.340 --> 25:38.200
majority

25:38.200 --> 25:39.480
of that.

25:39.780 --> 25:40.180
There were

25:40.180 --> 25:41.200
small amounts,

25:41.640 --> 25:42.300
single digits

25:42.300 --> 25:42.860
of millions

25:42.860 --> 25:43.460
of dollars,

25:44.200 --> 25:44.540
low to

25:44.540 --> 25:45.640
mid-single digits

25:45.640 --> 25:46.140
and millions

25:46.140 --> 25:46.560
of dollars

25:46.560 --> 25:47.080
in the other

25:47.080 --> 25:47.780
four business

25:47.780 --> 25:48.160
groups,

25:48.160 --> 25:49.200
and then

25:49.200 --> 25:49.740
from a

25:49.740 --> 25:50.800
portfolio

25:50.800 --> 25:52.560
and supply

25:52.560 --> 25:53.320
chain footprint

25:53.320 --> 25:54.200
optimization,

25:54.940 --> 25:55.660
the vast

25:55.660 --> 25:56.440
majority of

25:56.440 --> 25:56.820
that is

25:56.820 --> 25:57.420
impacting

25:57.420 --> 25:58.300
the

25:58.300 --> 25:59.520
electronics

25:59.520 --> 26:00.080
and energy

26:00.080 --> 26:00.640
business

26:00.640 --> 26:01.660
with a little

26:01.660 --> 26:02.180
of that

26:02.180 --> 26:03.000
hitting the

26:03.000 --> 26:03.520
consumer

26:03.520 --> 26:05.020
and office

26:05.020 --> 26:05.540
business,

26:06.160 --> 26:06.680
the consumer

26:06.680 --> 26:07.380
business group.

26:08.800 --> 26:08.980
Yeah,

26:09.040 --> 26:09.540
Rob,

26:09.720 --> 26:09.920
we,

26:11.320 --> 26:12.200
as far as

26:12.200 --> 26:13.040
the automation

26:13.040 --> 26:14.100
portion of our

26:14.100 --> 26:14.980
CapEx spending,

26:15.440 --> 26:16.140
a year ago

26:16.140 --> 26:16.920
at our investor

26:16.920 --> 26:17.280
meeting,

26:17.380 --> 26:17.880
we laid out

26:17.880 --> 26:18.160
that we

26:18.160 --> 26:18.840
expected that

26:18.840 --> 26:19.160
to be

26:19.160 --> 26:20.800
a noticeable

26:20.800 --> 26:21.760
part of our

26:21.760 --> 26:22.780
CapEx investments.

26:22.960 --> 26:23.300
What we're

26:23.300 --> 26:23.960
seeing is

26:23.960 --> 26:24.660
that's playing

26:24.660 --> 26:25.400
out exactly

26:25.400 --> 26:26.360
as we laid

26:26.360 --> 26:26.840
out a year

26:26.840 --> 26:27.140
ago,

26:27.240 --> 26:28.100
that we're

26:28.100 --> 26:28.360
seeing

26:28.360 --> 26:28.920
continued

26:28.920 --> 26:29.660
opportunities

26:29.660 --> 26:31.420
for automation

26:31.420 --> 26:33.020
investments

26:33.020 --> 26:33.640
within our

26:33.640 --> 26:35.140
CapEx plans,

26:35.440 --> 26:36.480
and I

26:36.480 --> 26:36.940
wouldn't call

26:36.940 --> 26:37.240
it an

26:37.240 --> 26:37.780
uptick,

26:38.020 --> 26:38.340
but I'd

26:38.340 --> 26:38.660
say it's

26:38.660 --> 26:39.660
playing out

26:39.660 --> 26:40.380
exactly as

26:40.380 --> 26:40.940
we laid

26:40.940 --> 26:41.220
out.

26:43.160 --> 26:43.720
Supply

26:43.720 --> 26:44.480
chain and

26:44.480 --> 26:45.100
portfolio

26:45.100 --> 26:46.160
optimization,

26:46.960 --> 26:47.520
and much

26:47.520 --> 26:48.160
less around

26:48.160 --> 26:48.720
growth.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.440
If we

26:50.440 --> 26:51.100
see growth

26:51.100 --> 26:53.000
even higher

26:53.000 --> 26:53.840
than what

26:53.840 --> 26:54.660
we're currently

26:54.660 --> 26:55.300
expecting,

26:55.820 --> 26:56.280
could our

26:56.280 --> 26:56.620
growth

26:56.620 --> 26:57.280
investments

26:57.280 --> 26:57.780
tick up

26:57.780 --> 26:58.160
some?

26:58.720 --> 26:59.100
I think

26:59.100 --> 27:00.280
the short

27:00.280 --> 27:00.800
answer is

27:00.800 --> 27:01.040
yes,

27:01.080 --> 27:01.440
it could

27:01.440 --> 27:02.080
tick up

27:02.080 --> 27:02.540
some,

27:02.760 --> 27:03.240
but I

27:03.240 --> 27:03.700
don't think

27:03.700 --> 27:04.320
on a

27:04.320 --> 27:04.760
material

27:04.760 --> 27:05.400
basis.

27:05.960 --> 27:06.200
I think

27:06.200 --> 27:06.520
we're now

27:06.520 --> 27:06.960
talking

27:06.960 --> 27:09.380
single digits

27:09.380 --> 27:09.940
of pennies

27:09.940 --> 27:10.280
at that

27:10.280 --> 27:10.520
point.

27:10.520 --> 27:10.900
thanks,

27:10.960 --> 27:11.140
Steve.

27:12.740 --> 27:13.040
Yeah,

27:13.140 --> 27:13.340
Steve,

27:13.420 --> 27:14.140
thanks for

27:14.140 --> 27:14.700
the question.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.600
Part of

27:16.600 --> 27:17.020
what we

27:17.020 --> 27:17.680
talked about

27:17.680 --> 27:18.260
a little

27:18.260 --> 27:18.720
over a

27:18.720 --> 27:19.320
year ago

27:19.320 --> 27:20.540
at our

27:20.540 --> 27:21.080
outlook

27:21.080 --> 27:22.840
meeting for

27:22.840 --> 27:23.600
the five-year

27:23.600 --> 27:23.900
outlook

27:23.900 --> 27:25.360
meeting is

27:25.360 --> 27:26.380
the number

27:26.380 --> 27:27.500
of manufacturing

27:27.500 --> 27:28.180
sites we

27:28.180 --> 27:28.680
have around

27:28.680 --> 27:29.320
the world

27:29.320 --> 27:30.940
and looking

27:30.940 --> 27:31.600
at the

27:31.600 --> 27:32.640
productivity

27:32.640 --> 27:33.360
in those

27:33.360 --> 27:33.860
sites and

27:33.860 --> 27:34.580
the opportunity

27:34.580 --> 27:35.340
we have

27:35.340 --> 27:36.260
through

27:36.260 --> 27:37.880
rationalizing

27:37.880 --> 27:39.400
the number

27:39.400 --> 27:39.900
of those

27:39.900 --> 27:40.340
sites,

27:40.900 --> 27:41.540
increasing

27:41.540 --> 27:42.460
capital into

27:42.460 --> 27:43.000
some of

27:43.000 --> 27:43.620
our more

27:43.620 --> 27:44.060
productive

27:44.060 --> 27:44.580
sites,

27:45.200 --> 27:46.140
the opportunity

27:46.140 --> 27:47.040
to reduce

27:47.040 --> 27:47.640
the total

27:47.640 --> 27:49.720
footprint of

27:49.720 --> 27:50.580
our manufacturing

27:50.580 --> 27:51.260
and supply

27:51.260 --> 27:51.780
chain

27:51.780 --> 27:54.820
sites over

27:54.820 --> 27:55.300
the course

27:55.300 --> 27:55.800
of the next

27:55.800 --> 27:56.480
four years.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.580
So that's

27:57.580 --> 27:58.080
what we mean

27:58.080 --> 27:58.660
when we talk

27:58.660 --> 27:59.060
about it

27:59.060 --> 27:59.340
when we

27:59.340 --> 27:59.760
laid out

27:59.760 --> 28:01.000
a $500

28:01.000 --> 28:01.600
to $600

28:01.600 --> 28:02.940
million investment

28:02.940 --> 28:03.400
that we

28:03.400 --> 28:04.000
expect to

28:04.000 --> 28:04.320
take.

28:04.720 --> 28:05.380
The resulting

28:05.380 --> 28:06.160
productivity

28:06.160 --> 28:06.920
from that

28:06.920 --> 28:07.600
that by

28:07.600 --> 28:07.940
the time

28:07.940 --> 28:08.240
we get

28:08.240 --> 28:08.880
to 2020

28:08.880 --> 28:09.360
we think

28:09.360 --> 28:09.700
that will

28:09.700 --> 28:10.740
add another

28:10.740 --> 28:11.820
$125 to

28:11.820 --> 28:12.680
$175

28:12.680 --> 28:13.780
million of

28:13.780 --> 28:15.080
added operating

28:15.080 --> 28:15.760
income to

28:15.760 --> 28:17.180
that productivity

28:17.180 --> 28:18.080
we can get

28:18.080 --> 28:18.440
through.

28:18.820 --> 28:19.440
Look at this

28:19.440 --> 28:20.080
globally,

28:20.400 --> 28:20.660
Steve.

28:20.800 --> 28:21.560
We had a

28:21.560 --> 28:22.340
positive,

28:22.620 --> 28:23.040
though very

28:23.040 --> 28:24.040
small price

28:24.040 --> 28:26.720
in all

28:26.720 --> 28:27.280
businesses

28:27.280 --> 28:27.960
except for

28:27.960 --> 28:28.320
healthcare

28:28.320 --> 28:28.840
where we

28:28.840 --> 28:29.360
were flat.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.440
To the

28:30.440 --> 28:31.160
first question

28:31.160 --> 28:32.960
on business,

28:33.520 --> 28:34.120
and I'll go

28:34.120 --> 28:34.660
further in

28:34.660 --> 28:35.240
geography,

28:35.240 --> 28:36.940
we expect

28:36.940 --> 28:37.820
that this

28:37.820 --> 28:39.500
action that

28:39.500 --> 28:39.980
we're taking

28:39.980 --> 28:40.300
in the

28:40.300 --> 28:41.000
second quarter

28:41.000 --> 28:41.580
and in

28:41.580 --> 28:41.920
the third

28:41.920 --> 28:42.320
and fourth

28:42.320 --> 28:42.740
quarter

28:42.740 --> 28:45.020
will impact

28:45.020 --> 28:46.660
all businesses

28:46.660 --> 28:47.300
and all

28:47.300 --> 28:48.100
geographies,

28:48.300 --> 28:50.100
that it will

28:50.100 --> 28:51.740
be broad.

28:52.060 --> 28:52.600
As far as

28:52.600 --> 28:53.300
the specific

28:53.300 --> 28:54.400
details of

28:54.400 --> 28:55.680
each business,

28:56.040 --> 28:57.060
we're still

28:57.060 --> 28:57.620
working through

28:57.620 --> 28:58.320
those details.

28:58.460 --> 28:58.740
We're not

28:58.740 --> 28:59.840
ready to be

28:59.840 --> 29:00.440
sharing that

29:00.440 --> 29:00.800
yet,

29:00.800 --> 29:01.780
Lawrence.

29:01.780 --> 29:04.040
And then

29:04.040 --> 29:05.060
as far as

29:05.060 --> 29:05.820
the 17

29:05.820 --> 29:06.740
to 18,

29:07.300 --> 29:07.760
some of

29:07.760 --> 29:08.380
these actions

29:08.380 --> 29:08.860
will have

29:08.860 --> 29:09.420
a tail

29:09.420 --> 29:10.460
into 18

29:10.460 --> 29:10.960
where there

29:10.960 --> 29:11.480
will be

29:11.480 --> 29:12.720
residual cost

29:12.720 --> 29:13.320
impact

29:13.320 --> 29:14.580
hitting us

29:14.580 --> 29:15.120
in 18,

29:15.580 --> 29:15.980
though I

29:15.980 --> 29:17.080
expect it

29:17.080 --> 29:18.280
will not,

29:18.660 --> 29:19.660
I very much

29:19.660 --> 29:20.180
expect it

29:20.180 --> 29:20.640
will be a

29:20.640 --> 29:21.400
decline from

29:21.400 --> 29:21.860
the level

29:21.860 --> 29:22.620
that we're

29:22.620 --> 29:23.400
projecting now

29:23.400 --> 29:24.280
for 2017.

29:24.280 --> 29:24.420
you.

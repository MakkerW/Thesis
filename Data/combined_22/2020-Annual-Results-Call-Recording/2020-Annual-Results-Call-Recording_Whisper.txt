 Thank you very much, Jeremy. And good afternoon to everyone. And, you know, thank you for
 making the time to join us on this call today.
 I'd like to again, you know, apologize for the delay due to technical issues.
 We'll try to extend the call for a few minutes
 over to be able to accommodate the delay as a result of that.
 As mentioned, I'll talk about our initiatives to support the fight against COVID-19, and
 update you on our operational performance as well as touch on some regulatory issues
 and before we look at that, you know, the outlook for 2021.
 In 2020, general economic and business performance
 was influenced by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic
 with devastating impacts across the globe.
 In Ghana, we experience ex-significant contraction in the first half of the year, with some signs
 of improved economic activity in the second.
 Indeed, the impact of the pandemic has been felt by everyone, and many of us have loved
 ones who have been affected by COVID-19.
 COVID-19. MTN Ghana and our staff have also been impacted by COVID-19, notwithstanding
 in the initiatives we've put in place to ensure the safety of our people.
 On yesterday's data from the Ministry of Information, Ghana has had 81,245 confirmed cases, 6,614 of
 which are still active, and 584, unfortunately, is there.
 For us at MTN Ghana, we have had a total of 138 of our staff who tested positive with
 COVID-19, we're thankful that 80 of those have since recovered all those that one employee
 as possible.
 Our thoughts are with the family of our lost colleague and with the nation as we go through
 these tough times together.
 It's in light of these challenges that we at MTN launched our Yellow Hope initiatives
 to provide support to our people, our customers,
 our partners, and to the governments of Ghana.
 In support of our customers,
 we zero-rated all our money P2P, peer-to-peer,
 transfers up to a value of 100 gana cities per day from March 2020.
 This did not only save our customers over 94 million Ghana cities in fees, but also facilitated
 greater social distancing and deepen financial inclusion to increase the adoption of digital
 currency. We're happy to announce that this offer is still active. To further support
 government efforts.
 The MTN Ghana Foundation donated five million
 and gonna see his worth of PPEs.
 In other words, same shells for the government,

 to deploy PPEs and sanitizers, as well as ensure the adherence to all COVID-19 safety protocols
 across our branch network and offices.
 will continue to prioritize the safety of our customers and our people through this period
 and beyond.
 In supporting the efforts of government agencies,
 user-arrated several public websites providing help and other COVID-19 related information.
 We also provided free access to over 200 websites for academic use by public and private education
 institutions and committed to providing this until the end of the pandemic.
 MT and Ghana supported with several other initiatives targeted at educational institutions,
 government agencies, and various ministries at a forefront of the fight against COVID-19.
 the details of which are included in the SEN's release document.
 In August 2020, we launched the BY's campaign to encourage Ganiyans to wear their face masks
 to weigh them correctly.
 And this transition into MTN's global where is for me campaign to build awareness around
 the importance of correctly wearing a fake mask to combat the spread of the virus.
 The fight against the pandemic continues into 2021 and MTN remains committed to provide an ongoing
 in support to combat COVID-19.
 In January 2021, MTN Group announced a 25 million de-legitimation to support the African
 Union's COVID-19 vaccination program that the nation would help secure out to 7 million
 doses of the vaccine for health workers across the continent, contributing to the best nation
 initiative of the African Census for Disease Control and Prevention.
 MTN Ghana is pleased to play its part in this initiative to support the governance of Ghana.
 As of the end of December 2020, the cumulative value of MTN Ghana's efforts to fight COVID-19
 was one billion, nine billion ganasetees.
 As we progress through 2021,
 We will remain focused on supporting our people,
 our partners and our customers while ensuring network resilience and efficiency in delivering
 and our quest to make the lives of our customers
 the whole of Brighton.
 I will now turn to operational results for the year 2020.
 We're pleased with our overall performance
 in a very challenging period.
 but good growth in our subscriber base,
 which was helped by the heightened need
 for reliable and resilient data and digital services.
 in this era of the pandemic.
 to help maintain the quality and availability of service
 for our data and mobile money customers.
 We invested 1.5 billion ganas, 1.5 billion ganas in network capacity and infrastructure
 expansion.
 As part of this, we rolled out 202G, 203G, and 950LT sites, which helped relieve the
 pressure on our infrastructure and significantly enhance our service delivery across the nation.
 Our SmartPAPX deployment helps support a 105% group in data traffic and reach 1.875 total
 4G side nationwide. That's 1,875 total 4G side nationwide. This is unlinked to a 7.1.7

 Voice revenue grew by 8.1% year on year and was supported by a 23.4% increase in our subscriber base, as well as various customer value management initiatives, which help manage churn and improve usage.

 would be the SMP and localization.
 In terms of S&P, we continue to have productive and constructive engagement with regulators
 and our policy makers.
 However, due to the elections in December,
 and the ongoing vet and appointment of the substantive ministries.
 these discussions have stalled since late November to early December. We're optimistic
 that will continue these discussions to influence the implementation of the remedies to achieve
 SMP going forward.
 Our primary objective is to ensure that the remedies that are implemented have a long
 in terms of impact on the sustainability of the industry.
 In terms of localization, we're committed to continue to progress localization to achieve
 to 25% localization target agreed with the government of Ghana.
 In December last year, December 2020, we launched an Employee Share Options Program, which
 which has committed an additional 4.41% towards localization.

 We look forward to seeing you in the next video.

 Just a quick update on MTN Ghana's 25th anniversary.
 The year 2021 marks a significant milestone in the journey of MT and GANIS contribution
 to providing vital telecommunication
 and digital services in Ghana.
 As part of our 25th anniversary, we're committing the equivalent of $25 million U.S. dollars,
 which is approximately 150 million Ghana cities
 to a fund supporting Ghana's post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.
 I'm saying that I would also work to deepen its strategic partnership with the governments
 of Ghana through investments in digital ecosystem projects
 as part of the government's long-term transformation agenda.
 We're excited about this development,
 grateful to our customers and stakeholders for their support.
 More details will be shared as discussions and agreements progress with governments in
 in our partners.
 This will be Outlook.
 The outlook for 2021 will be shaped by the extended impact of the pandemic, while economic
 group projections by entities such as the World Bank and that IMS are optimistic.
 cautious due to the potential longer-term dampening effect of COVID-19 on the Ghana economy.
 As a business, we remain focused on our people, on our customers, and on supporting government
 through the provision of a resilient network
 to support economic growth.
 We continue to target service revenue growth
 within our guidance range of 13% to 15%.
 and employee prudent cost strategies
 to continue to improve our margins
 and further ensure growth in our bottom line.
 MTN Ghana will continue to prioritize its investment in infrastructure expansion to meet the needs
 of Ganyan in this era of accelerated digitalization.
 growth in service revenue would largely be driven by data, more of financial services
 and digital. In 2021, we will continue our journey from a traditional mobile telecoms

 I will now hand over to the conference called Operator for questions and answers.
 Thank you very much.
 Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then 1 now.
 If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star and then 2.
 Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then one.
 The first question we have is from John Kim from UBS.
 Hi everybody, thanks for the opportunity.
 Two unrelated questions, please.
 Firstly, cash flow to the group level.
 We should be thinking about the management fee
 as well as the dividend.
 All the dividend calcs we should be using about 83%,
 if I heard you correctly, of the collective dividend up to group question mark.
 Second question, I know that there's been some legal process around Ntiengana being declared
 dominant. That's done and dusted, and have you seen any remedies or do you know of ones to come?
 Thank you.
 Okay, thank you for your question. Can you just clarify the very first question about
 I wasn't sure if it was just a statement or a question.
 question, I wasn't quite sure what the question itself was.
 Sure, my understanding is that Ghana pays a management fee to group and it's also entitled
 to a share of the dividend at the Ghanaian level.
 And my understanding from what you said earlier,
 is that's about an 83% ownership.
 Okay.
 So, what was the question? You want us to clarify that or?
 Because you've restated the facts and it's correct.
 so I'm not sure what exactly the question is.
 Hi, sorry, can you quantify that for us?
 and either RANS, CDE, or more dollars, please.
 Okay.
 The total dividends and management fee paid out to group.
 Please.
 Okay, all right.
 So I'll hand that question over to Koby, who's the active CFL.
 before Koby comes in.
 So let me just answer the question on SMP.
 And yes, you know, MTN was declared a significant market power, market player in July 2020.
 And as soon as they have a number of developments, at this stage in October 2020, we implemented
 one of the seven remedies that were imposed on us, and which was a 30 percent reduction
 in asymmetric in the connect rate.
 And we continue to have dialogue.
 and discussions with the regulators.
 why we look at the implementation of the remaining six remedies.
 Our primary objective is to get to a point where the remedies that are implemented have
 a long-term impact on the sustainability of the industry.
 It's really important because that will ensure that they're
 objectives of SMP are met broadly, as opposed to a reduction in MTNs performing based, but
 you know, minimal impact on the industry.
 So that's really what the discussions are about.
 and the engagement so far have been encouraging.
 However, you know, it's stalled to some degree following the election in December and the
 the ongoing process to appoint the substantive minister for communications and digital.
 Once that process is concluded, we'll be able to resume discussions and progress, and
 and we'll be able to give an update
 at the next quarterly investor call.
 Thank you.
 I'll hand it over to Cloby now to give you the numbers and the details for their dividend
 and management see it up to great things.
 This is Kobi for dividend and the managing fee that we expect to pay.
 It comes up to 9.49 million data series.
 We are paying dividend of $840 per about,
 management of 268 million.
 Okay, helpful. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Mayur and Rajaratnam from Mubfa.
 Hi guys.
 Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 First question is about the interconnect traffic regulations and S&P.
 We saw that the voice revenue increase wasn't great, actually, it was a decreased system
 in the fourth quarter if I get my numbers right. How much of the asymmetric
 cut this part of this, or is it purely just customer behavior and, or was it an additional
 competitive pressure or anything like that, because you added subscribers, I'm just trying
 and understand what are the dynamics behind this.
 then color would be useful.
 And the second question is excluding your wonderful product
 in wireless broadband, fixed broadband.
 and what's the average data usage per megabyte per customer?
 in megabytes per customer.
 Thank you
 Okay?
 Well, thank you very much.
 Let me start with the average, you know, data usage of the customer.
 We're currently seeing somewhere between 3.5 gigs per customer per month to somewhere around
 four gigs that customers pay money.
 And so that's the average that consumers are using.
 That number has increased during the year based on the demand for data and digital services
 as a result of COVID-19.
 Now, the question you asked on voice, yes, the voice trend, if we look at the voice trend
 of course, we'll report that for 2020.
 you would see a decline from a Q1 into Q4.
 However, the Q4 trend is actually a bit of an anomaly
 because there's some one-time adjustment effect
 that I've taken, please.
 So you know that trick will that to the top line revenue as well if you look at their year and year performance and in terms of voice
 Just to give you some comforts what we're seeing in Q1 at least in January so far we double digit growth
 year on year for the month.
 So again, just to pull that number into context,
 There were some one-off adjustments and, you know, interconnects was really the two best.
 The second component, which is not a one-time, but a permanent adjustment, will be the SMP.
 However, the MP effect is less than 1 percent or total revenue is about 0.6 percent and so
 So that effect is not just the most significant driver of the trend
 So we would expect to come back to our normal trends around, you know, late single visits
 to early double digits.
 as far as the voice, the voice growth year and year goes.
 That's great.
 I'm just to come back on the data usage per subscriber.
 Is that three and a half to four gigs per mobile subscriber, or is that also contains
 in the denominator, your fixed wireless LTE product as well, so it's just one of the
 variations.
 No, it's not mobile.
 Oh, that's pretty good. Thank you so much.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Prashantan Udaya from NetBank.
 Hi, everyone.
 Congratulations on the results,
 and thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 I've got two quick ones.
 I think the picture of it has been answered.
 but just on your Q4 operating metric.
 So, you know, your revenue and ever dark, it seems to have slowed down in the last quarter.
 Now, I know you're on the last question, on my urine's question, you mentioned that
 There was some one-off adjustment.
 Was there anything else that was causing the slowdown because you know up until September it was looking pretty strong
 both in terms of, like I said, revenue and margin, but quarter four looks quite weak and a huge slowdown.
 slow down.
 And then the second question, if I can,
 I know you guys announced a buyback of 1.1 million shares
 in December, and I think this had like a deadline
 to get KYC for the subscribers done by the 23rd,
 which was about two days ago.
 Is there any updates on that, on how much you guys have to do
 and how does that impact your overall localization to get to 25%?
 Thanks.
 Okay, thank you very much. Let me take the first question and I'll have Kobe answer the question on the buyback
 and what the implications are for localized nations.
 So, in terms of the third question, I think, you know, that's who we picked.
 When you look at overall performance, you mentioned revenue and EBITDA.
 I believe the answer I gave previously on the revenue side should satisfy the revenue
 And however, if you look at the EBITDA trend as well, there was some impact and an appearance
 of the slowdown. The reason for that is, primarily, once we had Eason app of supply chains, we're
 We're able to accelerate, or further accelerate, our COPEX deployment, and that has a dire
 impact on our A to D. So, for the previous quartet, because of that slowdown, we're not
 I've been wrecked with a couple of spins.
 actually would normally be.
 and a lot of that capex ended up being spent in Q4.
 So that's the explanation for the bottom line side
 in my previous answer should hopefully address the revenue side of that as well.
 Oh, thank you.
 Yeah, I can do that.
 Oh, sorry.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So, on the buyback, it's due to COIC issues as you are aware.
 We've managed this process with the regulator, so we are going to do the process of updating
 the KYCs of the Related Parties.
 we've gotten to the end of the process where the outstanding ones will be brought back and sold
 on to the market again.
 So that is the position where it has no effect on the 2.5% because that one is not a paid
 IPU, initial IPU that we had.
 That number is locked.
 it doesn't have any impact on that.
 COVID, I mean, can you give us an indication of how many of those that 1.1 million share
 subscribers have actually done their KYC, so the impact is going to be a lot
 depth in the 1.1.
 At the last shift of it, it's 1,420 potential shareholders updated their records tonight.
 Okay
 All right, thank you very much gentlemen
 Welcome.
 Thank you. The next question we have is from Jonathan Kennedy Goode from JP Morgan.
 I wanted to come back to your revenue guidance of 13% to 15%.
 mentioned that voice was growing double digits so far this year and the other
 the lines are all growing, you know, 20% in North of that.
 So just trying to understand why the conservative guidance is there potentially more competitive
 pressure on the voice arising given changes in termination rates.
 And then, second question, just on your digital revenue, tell us how many iOba users you
 actually have and what kind of revenue opportunities you've seen there, whether that's starting
 to scale somewhat.
 Okay.
 So let me just try to give some context first of all on the voice side.
 side. Yes, we're seeing double digit voice growth so far this year. It's one month in
 the year. However, what I said before was that we expect the only year boys grow the
 somewhere between the high single digits to the early double digits, right?
 and voice is something like 40%, 41% of total revenue.
 single-digit, late single-digit, to early double-digit,
 We only had growth.
 We'll pull down the bulk of the total revenue.
 That's the fifth reason why the estimate isn't that big
 The second component is that, you know, one, SMP deployment or remedy implementation has
 only status, so there will be some incremental impact of SMP to turn on where we land with
 the ministry, which, while a new development before we gave our estimates of 13 to 15,
 We've maintained the estimates of that into 15.
 despite the impact, the incremental impact
 of some of the S&P measures.
 And so I think, you know, it's a reasonable assessment
 of where we believe would land by the end of the year.
 In terms of Iyoba users, we ended last year over 700,000 Iyoba users, and in terms of
 revenue today. I mean, we're not really generating revenue from my yield, but it's a platform
 strategy that we have in mind.
 you're very intended to be a stupla app.
 At this stage, it's really driving adoption
 building a usage behavior and monetization will be at another stage and so for now revenue
 is not a primary focus. We're just building a base so that we can expand on the platform
 capabilities of a yoga, a part of our long-term strategy.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. The next question we have is from from Sunil Raj Kapal from HSBC. Please go ahead.
 Hi. I just wanted to check on the regulatory developments. I mean, I know, you know, some
 some impositions are made right now.
 And what is your take for all the discussions
 that are ongoing with the regulator
 And do you expect any more new rules coming up on this?
 Thanks for your question.
 I think the first thing to point out is that there were seven remedies that were imposed
 at the time of, you know, sending FBSNP and designation.
 And of those, only one has been implemented.
 While our discussions have been encouraging, we would expect, you know, a few more to be
 implemented through the year.
 What we're focused on currently in our engagement is really there, implementation, the definition
 of those specific remedies to ensure that the broader objective of S&P is achieved.
 And those discussions, like I said, have stalled since the elections, and one's the substantive
 Ministers put in place.
 We will resume those discussions and progress and progress to a point where we can give
 be something more specific probably at the next quarterly app
 But for now we've implemented the one which is 30% reduction in asymmetric interconnect
 and we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward.
 And maybe if I can just follow up, I mean, what would you think, probably, is the main
 implications would be given that the government is planning to acquire or propose to acquire
 one of these color operators there so what kind of potential implications we will see there from
 from that moment.
 It's a very difficult question to answer because there has really been very little
 shared on this acquisition by government of SLTGO.
 Now, just to point out, typically, in a situation where there's an acquisition from a buyer,
 would understand the investment appetite, the ambition of the new buyer, if it's really
 to hold the same position if it's really to challenge for number one, number two, if it's really to build scale.
 And based on that understanding, we'll be able to model a potential impact.
 At this point, the only thing that has been shared is the fact that government interest
 is to ensure that jobs are secured and jobs are saved.
 And however, on the business side,
 there's been no indication of the ambition
 a new indication of the potential investment strategy of a potential new buyer.
 And we also understand that government's role may be just to hold and attract new investors.
 So we're still at a very early stage as far as what the outcome of this process would
 look like and based on that would have a much more concrete sense of the impact.
 So I apologize.
 to give you a real sense, but we continue to monitor this and to the extent that we can
 and share thoughts and impact we will.
 Sure, thank you.
 Thank you.
 The question we have is from Nick Padgett from Frontura Capital.
 And again, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.
 Thank you.
 I again want to apologize, I again want to ask about revenue that some of the other questioners have asked about.
 Undoubtedly, in total, it was a great year for 2020.
 as others have mentioned, Q4, the revenue pace was a little softer and I've heard everything
 you've said so far, but I saw a few, you know, uncertainties about the Q4 numbers.
 So, you know, my observation is that...
 If we look at the two prior years, you're going back to 2018 Q4 revenue was 15% higher than Q3 and in 2019 it was 9% higher.
 but, you know, this year it was basically flat.
 I heard you say there were some one-offs, but that would be quite a bit of one-off to
 to, you know, be that, to explain all of that difference.
 So, I wonder, is there something else?
 Like, you know, COVID really I think helped your revenue
 in the first three quarters.
 Could it be that things are normalizing?
 And so the slower growth is the result of the normalization.
 although your guidance, as mentioned, is sort of unchanged,
 So that maybe is counter to that point.
 Or was there just anything else?
 unique about
 for other than the one-offs or maybe the one-offs were bigger than I thought I'm just still you know
 still looking for some additional kind of clarity on that if you could explain Q4.
 Sure let me let me start by saying if we if we normalize the effects for the adjustments that we made
 Q4 over Q3 would have been about a 9% year-on-year growth.
 So it would have been in line with 2019, as you mentioned.
 So that's a starting point, right?
 If I take the second point, are we seeing a change in trend from a consumer behavior
 standpoint, the answer is yes. I mean we're seeing a lot more people using data and digital
 as far as, you know, the pandemic goes,
 changes in behavior from people going to physical school and now at home working.
 But if I look at the Q1 to Q4 trends, it doesn't suggest that there is a specific issue, right?
 If we look at what happened in Q4, most of our schools went back, and therefore the usage
 of data from home would have gone down, but they'll be compensated for by other behaviors.
 So, there's quite a lot going on in terms of shifts in behavior, and one of the reason
 of the res...
 restrictions start to unfold, those behavior changes that we saw in Q2, Q3 would be reversed
 as well.
 a lot of mix going on. But organically, yes, we're seeing a slower growth in voice than
 and we're seeing for the other areas, which is expected,
 But not to the extent that the numbers will depict you, because if we normalize, we're
 a s-
 something like a 9% junior group.
 Okay.
 9% sequential from Q3 to Q4, X1, OST.
 Okay, so that's, thank you for clarifying that.
 That's more than I would have guessed and maybe you said that number at the beginning and I missed it
 But there are no problems.
 So, what, I mean, given that is such a large number,
 What kind of one-offs?
 What kind of adjustments would these be?
 I guess that it clarifies one answer and then raises a new question of just what are those
 I wouldn't have guessed that kind of one-offs could occur.
 Sure, so outside of SMP, there was interconnect,
 and there was also a principal agent adjustment
 on the digital side that affected the overall twiddle business.
 And perhaps we can go offline and go into a bit more detail on this, if you would like,
 the finance team can work you through this.
 Okay, but those are the two areas that we made the adjustment.
 Okay.
 So, I'm going to ask this because I think it's on my mind and probably others, and I
 I understand you probably won't be able to answer it.
 I'll just ask anyway for the benefit of everyone, you know, sometimes we see when a company has a great nine months, you know
 So, they take the foot off the accelerator a bit and they still report a very good year.
 discretionary items that don't necessarily have to be recognized, are recognized in Q4.
 And so I just can't help wondering if that's the case of maybe the Q4 you report is a bit
 of a low aberration because you could still have a great year anyway and that just sets
 you up for another good growth year next year.
 Now, it's a creative question, but no, the answer is no.
 You know, we had to make these adjustments and and we should see an evening out of these through the year. So, okay
 Fair enough. Thank you for answering.
 You're welcome
 Thank you. The next question we have is from Ali Nasir from Burgers.
 Thank you for the opportunity.
 I just have questions around a moment, please.
 Maybe starting with the structure of any potential transaction that takes local ownership to
 and 30% by the new timeline.
 I'm just curious.
 How do you ensure that the interests of empty and gone
 shareholders are not only protected but maximized in case of a transaction and how do you, you
 you know, what kind of transaction options do you foresee to get to 30 percent?
 Okay.
 So, at this point...
 Okay.
 So, at this point...
 I mean it's, you know, it's a bit early for us to tell.
 However, what I can say is, if you look at the SCANCOM levels, SCANCOM is it, who owns
 You know, for more money limiters to hold you in sub-seed areas, can we?
 And then we're able to achieve the 25% of SCANCOM and split the shareholdings across
 That's my money, limited.
 we would have achieved 25% of this 30%.
 So the question you're asking really applies to the 5% surplus above the 25%.
 We haven't defined a structure for that as yet.
 And but just to sort of explain the component of the 30%
 that will be impacted by the question.
 it would be the 5% that remains.
 And, you know, once we make progress on this, we'll share that with you.
 But again, the interest of shareholder will absolutely be taken into consideration for
 effect, which I say you should, and things like that.
 I'm sure that's where the question is going.
 Yeah, no, but I didn't even think about indirect.
 So that's really helpful.
 Just on that point, the ESOP,
 Will that need to vest in 2021 for it to count
 local shares or it doesn't have a longer rest duration, though it has a longer
 best in duration, and so there are two components there in about three years to five years so.
 Okay, so you would you would recognize the local I guess you'd recognize these chairs as they best
 because they count as local shares, right?
 That's right, but the allocation would be made, but it would become real shares once they
 That would be better.
 Thank you.
 And just operationally on MOMO, the monetization has been really impressive.
 if you look at this, rather than the average user.
 Can you just talk about some of the initiatives
 that you've put in place this year or whether consumers have changed the way they use animal
 that have given that monetization.
 And then the second part of that question is,
 I've noticed that the subscriber growth in Momo has lagged voice and data in the year
 And I was wondering, you know, what do you think is preventing faster adoption and penetration
 among your voice users.
 Okay.
 I think a way to think about that, let me just start with the growth in Momo, both Momo
 and data have about the same number of active users,
 You're 10.7, 10.8.
 So the difference is not really significant.
 Because you really think about the need for data investors, the need for more money in
 in a year like we've just had,
 And then it's actually quite impressive that Momoi is keeping the same, is keeping pace
 with data growth in terms of subscribers.
 So I think, you know, we may have under indexed in daytime previous years and we may have
 done better, which is why you've seen a slight difference in the percentages.
 but if you look at the actual numbers,
 MoMoIn active dates are at exactly this thing
 using the MPN definition, which for me suggests that Moomoo is actually doing quite well.
 So that's a fair point.
 In terms of monetization, a number of things have happened.
 You know, one, we've increased subs by about 60%, but we've also seen a significant increase
 in usage in average transactions per user.
 And it's really important because if you're
 look at other markets that, you know,
 Machio Kenya, for example.
 The biggest driver of output growth is increased frequency of transaction and to increased
 frequency of transactions across a broader base of sub-products within the more money
 sweet.
 about advanced services, things like our loan products,
 the national remittances, payment services.
 Those new products allow users to have a higher level
 of stickiness and subsequently a higher level of usage
 pay user per month.
 So we've seen significant growth there upwards of five
 transactions the month last year were sort of around the 4 to 4.5 so it's
 you know, a 20-30% increase in usage frequency as well.
 So those are the primary drivers.
 and as we continue to expand our product portfolio,
 which should continue to see these usage frequencies increase over the coming year as well.
 as well.
 That's great. And that's also in the context of zero rating on the 100 study. That kind of growth.
 That's correct, yeah.
 That happens in the year.
 That's correct.
 Right.
 Okay.
 Yeah, just on that point, Salome, if you don't mind,
 As of, if you look forward to, or maybe just looking at 2020, how did this get out between
 peer-to-peer and some of the new products that are, you know, more sticky in nature.
 Sure.
 If I take our advanced services in total, we're talking sort of 12% to 15% in terms
 sense of revenue.
 So they're still growing as far as the product mix is concerned, and the level of adoption
 and there's also still growth.
 But if we think of the future, you know, advanced services really represent the future of more
 money because the basic transactions, P2P, cash in, cash out, will start to normalize
 in terms of incremental growth.
 So for us, it's really building the foundations for the future and making sure that mix, you
 We get that mixed right so that we can continue to sustain the growth as we go forward.
 So that's really, really the response to that.
 Great last one just on this is just related to the float size which you show on the balance sheet. I think you've exceeded the billion dollars
 It's about doubled versus the 2019 December close.
 And I calculate that, I don't know if this is the right way of doing it,
 but if you look at kind of an average wallet size,
 it's now over a hundred US dollars, about a hundred and seven.
 And I was just wondering if that is consistent with what you observe or am I looking at things, you know
 on an accounting basis because that seems like a big number for Ghana and the wallet size.
 Sure, I think the first thing to note is that the float covers a couple of different areas.
 It covers our merchants.
 It covers our consumers, and it covers our agents.
 And, you know, I believe sort of the bank fluid may be part of that as well.
 So...
 It's hard to take that number and just divide it by the number of customers and get the
 one its size.
 Yeah, that's what I thought.
 Okay, that sounds good.
 So thank you for that clarification.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you. So we have a few more questions on the conference call. Do you have time to take a few?
 Yeah, hi, maybe we can just do more questions, and then we can end the call.
 Not a problem.
 With this from Darren, it's just from 3.37 for Tear Capital.
 Hi. Good afternoon. Good morning. Congrats on the great results.
 A couple of questions for me.
 Could you just talk about the growth in both voice and data you're seeing?
 Do you have any indication if these are market share gains as the market growing as quickly
 you guys and could you talk a little bit about sort of any kind of pushback from
 your two competitors.
 It sounds like, as you said, Tigo and Caratel,
 That's a bit more complicated, but I'm just any update on competition would be helpful
 Also, the 139 million CDs that you guys booked as related to COVID initiatives, I'm assuming
 that's on the income statement and is it fair to assume that a lot of that comes out in
 2021 or are these going to be recurring expenses? And then last question, I just want to confirm,
 You said the advanced services in MOMO is around 12% to 13% of revenue.
 Last year, I think that was you guys were closer to like maybe two or three percent in that line
 Am I right in saying that and can you just unpack that a little bit where is the growth
 from that advanced services coming from.
 It sounds like you guys are gaining good momentum there.
 Okay, thanks, thanks for the question.
 Let me start with advanced services.
 Last year, we're just around 10%, not 3%.
 So we've seen something like a 40% to 50% growth in that line in terms of the percent
 to more money revenue.
 So that's just to clarify and the numbers you have.
 And the growth is really coming from pain where, you know,
 So we've continued to expand the number of meetings we had.
 We came out of last year with about 150,000 in next year and this year we ended this year
 with over 170,000 merchants, and we continue to see increased activity at various merchants'
 the point.
 The expansion of the merchants increases your ability to use and your opportunity to use your mobile money wallet.
 And in the year with the pandemic where there have been a lot of distinctions and things
 like that.
 that also accelerate and help accelerate
 the change in behavior.
 And can I ask you, the relationship that MTM group announced with MasterCard,
 Is that being implemented in Ghana as well, and is that?
 That's a global view for us, so yes, it will have an implication for Gainer as well.
 Okay
 Okay. Now, your second question was, you know, the 1.39 million, and just to break it down,
 This is the COVID impact for us in terms of what we spend in cash, but also what we've
 given up in revenue.
 So, the 139 includes the 94 million of T2P for more money limited and the balance of
 that would be what we spend in cash, which would show up in our income statements.
 And so, yes, we've continued the P2P, the free P2P for Haggagana cities daily.
 We've continued that so far in 2021.
 And in terms of the spend,
 we will continue to spend on COVID until we get to a point
 where we don't have any.
 So these numbers will be baked into 2051 as well.
 Got it.
 Okay.
 The first question was on voice and data and if we're seeing market share growth, I think
 in voice.
 your market share has been
 marginally growing but it's fairly flat and but in terms of data we've seen some
 market share growth.
 Unfortunately, we haven't had a recent release from the NCA regularly on the industry position
 and the numbers we have are quite old.
 until we receive that it's hard to give a very concrete sense of, you know, whether we're seeing market sharing date or not.
 I know all the operators as an industry there was a surge in demand for data and therefore
 to the extent that you're able to provide a capacity you would
 to see growth, especially during the COVID period.
 So I would expect that, you know, market share may have grown marginally in data or it will
 main about flancing load. That ought to have been an entire industry effect from COVID-19.
 Got it.
 Can I please go ahead?
 No, no, you continue on.
 you continue on
 No, as I was going to say, in terms of competition,
 I mean, the dynamics in the marketplace have been linked to the acquisition or the exit
 of Airtel and potentially Millicom from the market,
 Like I said before, we don't have enough detail to really
 that's attained and assessed what this means for our business going forward.
 And as soon as we have more information,
 we'll be able to share that.
 our focus continues to be.
 ensuring that we invest smartly.
 We continue to focus on resilience and quality of service,
 and we're also expanding our technology
 so that we can have 4G on every site in the coming years.
 And that continues to be our focus and also build out our home network and where we see
 a lot of opportunity in the future.
 Can I just, one related question on competition and mobile money?
 I mean, are you seeing, is there any competitive response there?
 I mean, you guys, my understanding.
 I mean, the bit of digging I can do to try to understand sort of the distribution and
 agent network for Vodacom and Airtel Tigo, I mean, it seems very, very limited.
 I mean, are they even trying in mobile money at this point?
 Or is the game yours right now?
 You know, it absolutely moves around.
 And, you know, for us, if you think about it,
 all money today. I mean, we're talking by the MTN definition about 10 million customers.
 We have a population of about 32, 31 million, so, I mean, that's only 30% of the total
 population from an active, well-money use of penetration standpoint.
 From that perspective, I mean, I think there is a lot of opportunity to continue to drive financial inclusion, you know, point one.
 But if you look at the frequency of transactions, it's still in single digits, where we should be in double digits.
 Now, to really get to double digits, you need an industry ecosystem maturity that allows
 that to happen, for which we would need the other players in the market to continue to
 to drive behaviors towards electronic currency, more money
 currency, things like that.
 So, to an extent, at this stage of the game,
 any effort from our competitors would help accelerate
 the growth in the industry because it's at such a nascent stage, I mean even though you
 I mean, where I don't know what's going on,
 I mean, we're at a very, very young stage in terms of the more money opportunity.
 So we don't see growth from our competitors as compromising the pie.
 We really see there's accelerates in the growth of the pie and we can have a much larger share of that growth in terms of, you know, in terms of this, in terms of the growth of the pie.
 We can have a much larger share of that incremental growth and so we encourage it we you know
 So we also do think there is an innovation engine that's lacking in the marketplace, and
 some of the initiatives from the central bank
 to try to lighten these smaller players.
 All of that will continue to drive innovation
 within the ecosystem to allow us to reach the maturity
 that we require to continue to grow faster.
 So, a lot of opportunity, I mean we don't see that as negative at all, we would encourage
 more people to invest because it drives the whole market, they still, you know, 90% of
 of cash usage in Ghana at the moment,
 despite the pandemic and all of that.
 So there's a lot of work to be done,
 And if we all bring our energies together as an industry,
 we'll get the ecosystem to grow.
 and we'll be able to all benefit from that.
 Got it. All right. Thanks so much and congrats again on the good great results. You're welcome
 Thank you. Final question is from Brad Buritzki from Equinox Partners.
 Thank you for
 Thank you for giving me the chance to ask a question.
 I have two questions. The first is, in the comments you talk about investing a billion
 going to have CB and network expansion.
 whereas the capex for the year is roughly around a billion.
 So I assume that, you know,
 the incremental half a billion CDs came out of the income statement.
 I'm curious sort of what part of the network expansion you capitalize and what part you
 expense. And then the second question is, so you can talk about 2021 being the year of the digital,
 or your digitalization.
 specific initiatives are you doing around that? And what is that?
 So in the last part of your question, you went, you sort of dropped off.
 if you can just start from the year of the customer and what initiatives.
 Yeah, what specific initiatives are you doing around that this year?
 what does it what does it really really mean that would be the year of the digital customer?
 Okay, all right, so I'll take the second question and the copy will answer the question of the capex where we look at the core capex versus the rest
 You can give it a details there, but let me start with a year of the customer.
 So when we talk about the year of the customer, there are a number of different things that
 we look at.
 about six pillars that we've developed in terms of digitizing our business.
 And, you know, one of them is, you know, operations internally trying to automate and digitize
 a lot of our process internally, a lot of us are working from home now, and therefore
 or it's not only a good to have or a nice to have,
 but it's a need to have so that we can continue
 to work effectively and support the business.
 So that's the first component, and I won't dwell too much on what that means, but we
 you can go into the details there.
 The second one is really on our product side, where to be able to look at some of the initiatives
 we've launched, we've gone from using scratch cards, you know, 15, 20 percent of our re-chart
 sales came from scratch cards two years ago and we've dropped that to about five percent
 last year and we're saying we're going to get to zero by the end of this year and again
 And that's, you know, part of digitizing our sales channel, our primary sales channel
 where you have newer channels that can support that transaction.
 So you have my MTN app, for example, we have, you know, electronic sales of recharge, as
 as far as agent goes.
 And you have these sort of different channels
 that you can purchase, reach out to them,
 you'd have online channels as well,
 website channels, and things like that.
 When we think about becoming a platform player
 in the next three to five years.
 then the foundation for that is really being built
 from our perspective around open API for mobile money
 where we can have, you know, customers accessing our APIs
 and connecting to us, you know, without having, you know,
 significant interaction with us.
 Looking at how I use a super app, which started off as a messaging app, but we're looking
 that implement in microapps.
 So you could think of WeChat in Asia.
 That's really what Ayuba looks like.
 And so currently we have about six or seven micro-ups already
 implemented. And we'll continue to expand on that, looking at relevant, local, local
 apps that can sit within the Ayova ecosystem and continue to expand that.
 So it's a very exciting time for us.
 Well, we're bringing a lot of things together.
 We see ourselves as sort of a central player where we can be the core of a lot of these
 transactions and the innovation from the startup industry can be on the outside of that core
 and connect to that core to be able to provide their services to get the end.
 When we think about customer experience,
 there is a lot of opportunity there as well.
 Today, I mean, we have a lot of people
 have to call into our call-send test.
 they have to walk to our snores to get basic service.
 And a lot of these things can be done if you haven't,
 if you have the right digital platform.
 My MTN is really the pivot for that, where we're seeking to allow people to do things
 themselves.
 to increase the percent of self-service interactions
 without a support team.
 And that's a big focus for us this year.
 So that number of initiatives around that,
 looking at things like chatbots, looking at AI,
 that can support customers remotely,
 looking at IVR solutions as well,
 which we already have in place, but really,
 to expand the usage of these to our customers
 because our customers tend to be a bit shy
 of adopting some of these solutions
 that we have in place.
 And so that's just to list a few of them,
 But there are several other things that we're doing beyond just support, beyond just sales
 channels on the product side, simplification about portfolio, digitize, and their interactions,
 of the days in our short codes.
 These are all things we're doing to simplify the journey
 and the experience for our customers.
 And finally, on the technology side,
 and ensuring that our technology platforms
 and infrastructure kind of supports
 and digital ecosystem.
 So the network, this is why having 4G on every site
 is important to us.
 and two, looking at modernizing our AI systems
 so that we can have the right environment
 from a security standpoint.
 from an operational standpoint and from a reliability standpoint to deliver on these
 digital services. So there's quite a lot of big event that we're working on. We're going
 to be very busy this year.
 All right
 Yeah, on the TPEX side, just to clarify, all TPEX pens are capitalized within the EDO
 care.
 none is set aside for any other.
 And beyond that, the core KPEX is the H5H
 that may be lid reference too.
 But to top the facts for 2020 when you you you check it on the IFR 16 was
 1.489, and on the IAS 17 is 1.397.
 So, so that's the details.
 So all of them are capitalized within the 2020 year.
 Thank you.
 to add that the difference between the core and the total will be things like licenses
 That is right, Colby.
 That's right.
 Licenses as a software that are related to network systems.
 Sorry, can you clarify on the campus question?
 So the number that I saw was...
 was
 It was even when you add the licenses and whatnot, it was still only just over one
 Yes, of all
 Because we have spectrums as well as core network assets.
 Spectrums were about 360 million so those ads are plus other software and licenses
 So maybe you have to look at what you are looking at and give you better clarity, but that looks good.
 Okay.
 Just one quick follow up on that is how much of your capex would you consider to be growth
 CapEx relative to maintenance CapEx.
 Okay.
 Again, I didn't quite catch what he said.
 How much of your...
 would you consider maintenance of the existing network versus
 Maintenance? Maintenance that treated as opaque. So maintenance doesn't form part of KPEX.
 I think to clarify, I think the question is, you know, we have maintenance
 cupcakes, which would be, we need to implement that to keep the network going with the existing
 capacity.
 And then
 Incremental capacity and coverage.
 adding capacity to existing networks.
 Yeah, perhaps we can take that offline and look at the breakdown if I may suggest. Yeah, that's what I
 as I guess that's all.
 So maybe we'll pick it up.
 and then let's get back to him on the details.
 Okay, thank you appreciate the time
 Thank you.
 Sir, do you have any closing comments?
 Yeah, please.
 So I'd like to thank everyone for making time to join us today for this call.
 Again, I would like to apologize for the long hold at the start of the call and the extension
 of the time of the call as a result of this food.
 I know there are quite a number of questions in the queue, but I'll be glad if you can
 reach out to me and then I can access you with your answer question.
 You can also visit the investor page on our website, that's ntn.com.gh, to download our
 financials and access any other relevant investment information, which includes the transcript
 and audio for this call, which I'll be adding up in the coming week.
 So thank you, and you may now end the call.
 Thank you ladies and gentlemen that then concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines
 Thanks.

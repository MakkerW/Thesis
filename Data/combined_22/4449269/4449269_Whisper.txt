 As you will see in Antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were strong.
 The Q2 results are a clear example that our strategic planning has been well executed
 with the right focus and discipline.
 showing significant improvement in our financial performance.
 Before we go into more details regarding the Q2 results,
 I'd like to highlight the good momentum we are going
 in the different business segments.
 In commercial aviation, we announced a new firm order for third E-195 E-2 jets from the
 Canadian porter airlines with purchase rights for 50 more aircraft.
 We also announced it.

 orders for 34 E175 jets to Horizon Air and Sky West to be operated for Laska
 lines and delta lines.
 These new orders and other active campaigns reiterate the continuous interest in the E-Jet
 family as the best option in the regional aviation market.
 In executive aviation, we keep up the momentum with the record sales in the quarter.
 We maintained our price discipline strategy and had a strong backlog growth with book
 to build in excess of two to one for this business.
 In defense and security, we delivered seven Super Tucano aircraft in the first half of
 the year.
 Also, we had strong performance in our cybersecurity and systems integration companies, with double
 digital revenue growth in the first half of this year.

 reached an important milestone by successfully performing unpaved runaway tests.
 Although, we are currently in negotiations with the Brazilian Air Force on the KC290

 insert craft as well as the supertocano.
 In services and support, we are pleased with strong second quarter results, with better

 this year, positively impacting working capital and production costs.
 I will now hand it over to Antonio Garcia, our CFO,
 to give further details on the financial results,
 and I will return in the end.
 Thank you.
 Thank you Francisco and good morning everyone. I will start with our backlog for the quarter
 On slide 7, the graph shows we ended the second quarter at 59 billion.
 Up.
 1.7 billion or 12% from the prior quarter.
 This represents a return to the same 15.9 billion we were at in 2020, before the pandemic
 began. In our commercial aviation business, we close 48 aircraft sails in a quarter and
 spread across several different airlines.
 in executive aviation.
 We had the record second quarter sales.
 A solid backlog as demand for lights and larger business jets continue to grow.
 Backlogging service and support and defense and security also grew from the prior quarter level.
 In summary, it was the best sales quarter since mid-2019.
 Please give us confidence in our plans for future revenue growth and improvements.
 Moving to slide 8, you can see the continuous improvement in aircraft delivers compared
 last year and both commercial aviation and executive aviation.

 We delivered 14 aircrafts in the quarter.

 Slide 10, SDNA expenses reduction continues to train very favorably over the last six quarters.
 We remain highly focused on the SDGNA efficiencies that are being implemented since the companies

 We are very encouraged by the strong margin performance across all business segments in
 the second quarter.
 Our adjusted habit margin was 9.3 percent up to

 Our adjusted ability to the margin was in double digits.

 This improvement comes from several factors, including higher deliveries, resulting in
 hires revenue, better gross margin on improved pricing, mix

 were as follows.
 commercial aviation was at 1.7% negative, which, although negative, shows a great improvement
 from last year.
 Executive Aviation was at positive 8% with a strong price discipline and consistent profitability.
 Defense and security was at positive 25 percent, led by Super Tucano Delivers along with positive
 adjustments on certain defense contracts.
 service and support was at 19% as a strong contribution from spare parts programs.
 If slide 12 shows our adjusted net income, it was positive 44 million or 24 cents per
 ADS in the second quarter.
 This represents the first net profit on a quarterly basis since 2018.
 The recovering adjusted net income is primarily driven by improved operating margins, reductions
 in financial leverage also contributes to improved profitability and any future debt
 reduction would naturally have any additional positive impact on earnings.
 Moving to slide 13, I'd like to begin with free cash flow.
 Free cash flow in the second quarter was positive 45 million
 272 million higher than first quarter, and 570 million higher than the same period of
 last year. This is a remarkable achievement. Although year-to-date, the cash flow is negative
 181 million. This is compared with a free cash flow board of around a billion of the

 We have been very judicious in balancing the need to invest our future with the need to preserve cash

 We ended the quarter with 2.49 billion cash and cash
 equivalence. I'd like to increase it from the end of the first quarter. Our depth balance
 This was at 4.3 billion.

 our average depth maturity remains at four years.
 We expect to continue to generate cash
 in the second half of 2021,
 And beyond so, our leverage will naturally decrease.
 This will, correspondingly, reduce our net interest and expenses and have an additional
 positive impact on their income.
 Finally, move it to a slide 16.
 Embraer has published 2021 financial delivers guidance for the first time since the start
 of the pandemic. Despite risks of the economy recovery, vaccination rates around the world,
 And with a solid first half and good visibility for the remain of the year, we decided to
 share the marked our targets for 2021.
 We expect to deliver between 54 to 50

 We expect consolidated revenues to be between $4 to $4.5 billion this year.
 representing a low double dividend growth
 at the mid-point compared to the last year.
 Adjusted ABIT margin should be in the range of 3% to 4% and adjusted ABIT for 2021 should
 be between 8.5 to 9.5 percent.
 Embraer has had in the first half of 2020,
 margin in these ranks, as we expect this good margins to repeat in the second half of the
 year.
 It's important to mention that those margins includes costs related to the integration
 of commercial aviation as well as spaces related to the arbitration process.
 Finally, our free cash flow guidance is arranged from free cash flow usage of 150 million to
 to a break even for 2021.
 We had 181 million of free cash flow users in the first half of the year.
 So we are anticipating a bear to generate up to 180 million cash in the second half of
 2021 without any cash inflows from M&A projects.
 With that, I conclude my presentation and hand it back over to Francisco for his final
 much. Thank you very much.
 Thanks, Antonio.
 The second quarter results and the guidance for the year reinforce our confidence in our
 strategy and this confidence motivates us to accelerate the performance
 improvements and the delivery of our long-term strategic plan with focus and
 and discipline.
 As I have mentioned in the past, this year is one of recovery.
 And next year and beyond, we plan to capture Embraer's full potential to grow with profitability.
 Looking ahead, we foresee, in the middle term, the potential to double the size of the company.
 that doesn't include new strategic projects.
 We are going to be bigger and stronger, focusing not only on the top line, but also much higher
 profitability.
 We are already showing some positive results
 of the hard work our united and motivated teams of employees have done over the past
 several months.
 with expectation for positive operating profit this year,
 and much better free cash flow performance
 with the clear potential to break even for the year.
 This will be supplemented by partnerships and new programs to drive even higher growth opportunities.
 communities. We are also advancing on our ESG journey.
 And right after the Q&A session, we will share with you our new ESG commitments.
 I invite everyone, therefore, to remain online for these ESG events, which we will start
 just after the results Q&A. Also, we are looking forward to a new chapter of
 of Embraer with our extraordinary sharehold meeting scheduled for next Monday.
 We expect our shareholders to approve the election
 of two international board members.
 with extensive global aerospace industry experience.
 Following constructive feedback from analysts and shareholders to improve our corporate
 governance.
 These candidates have deep technical knowledge, strategic profiles, and an innovative thought
 process.
 Finally, I will close it today by thanking everyone for this strong quarter.
 It always starts with our people and their focus and passion on executing our strategic
 planning. As I mentioned to you in the last earnings call, we are a different company today.
 We are in a process of transformation and we are moving fast.
 Thank you for your interest and confidence in our company.
 Over to you, Felipe.
 Thank you very much Francisco.
 And before we continue, we'd like to show you a video.
 Check this out.
 The world is a different place to a year ago.
 Industries have changed.
 Aviation perhaps more than any other.
 The Embraer has changed too.
 We're leaner, more agile, and fit for growth.
 We're already on a path that will make us bigger and stronger.
 and with an all new product portfolio
 that are the most efficient and technologically advanced
 in their class.
 all built with the passion to improve sustainability.
 Economics.
 cost efficiencies and driving new innovations were better adapted to the challenges and
 opportunities of now.
 Like our customers, we're always looking above and beyond
 what was previously thought possible.
 That's why the world looks to Embraer.
 We are right for the world ahead.
 Right now.
 Embraer.
 Challenge.
 Create.
 outperform.
 And now let's move on to our questions and answer session.
 preparing the set here and remember that questions can only be sent to the
 writer's platform.
 Eduardo Cotto will be our moderator, and he already has some questions with him.
 Eduardo, over to you.
 Thanks Philippe, we restart now the Q&A.
 So let me see the questions that we have.
 The first question we have is, can you give an update on the SPAC negotiations with Yves?
 I don't know Francis Quarantano, who wants to take that.
 Yes, thank you very much, thanks for the question.
 I mean, at this point of time we can say that the negotiation is moving very well, I would
 say.
 optimistic with this process.
 Okay
 Move it on the questions.
 Second question we have, what work has Embraer been doing
 doing to develop electric aircraft and making this product more viable for customers.
 Thank you.
 Thank you. That was a good question.
 Well, we had our first technical flight recently with Ipanema, full electric, and we hope to
 to present this aircraft to the public soon,
 and continue it to invest in this electrification field
 there's one of the
 one of the innovation fronts that we have.
 I mean, to be in line with the ESG activities
 that we are moving fast in Embraer.
 great
 Third question we have from investors is from Victor Misuzaki from Bradesco.
 He said the fence showed a material gross margin expansion in the second quarter.
 Can you give her more details about that, Antonio?
 Victor, thanks for the question.
 We had, in the second quarter, two main effects on the defense side.
 This one was the super kind of delivery that we were not able to deliver in Q1 that flows
 to the Q2 figures.
 In addition to it, we have the adjustment and the defense contract we have in the local
 occurs in Brazil. I would say both effects are delivered in super Tucano and the adjustment
 And then the contracts lead us to this 25% margin in Q2.
 Okay, very good.
 Next question comes from UBS.
 Could you comment on the 25 million reversal
 mentioned in the press release.
 Also, what was the positive cost-based revision related?
 related on the results.
 Thanks for the question, first point.
 We built up a provision in 2018
 for the Brazilian guys here,
 If there's an irration of the fault that we have a claim discussed, being discussed since
 you're-
 and we were able to gain this disclaim in second quarter.
 That's why we reversed this tax position.
 that was also read adjusted in 2018.
 That's why we also consider in our results.
 The second question was in regards to the contracts.
 We have an adjustment here around $10 million
 in the second quarter.
 that were both effects.
 It's important also to mention that even that we have this tax reversal, 25 million let's
 Let's put first quarter and the second quarter.
 We do have other types of costs that we are not adjusting.
 It's also not, I would say, for example,
 reintegration of commercial aviation and arbitration costs, which is more or less net this 25 million,
 I would say, the numbers we are seeing right now,
 would say combined Q1 and Q2 is really, for me,
 describe
 the real performance of the company.
 uh... we have several questions about uh... about if
 I'll try to summarize them.
 So basically, any general updates on your EVTAL initiatives
 would be very helpful.
 particularly on negotiations with Zenite.
 We already talk a little bit, but maybe an update of the EVTOL.
 Francisco and Tony.
 Well, as I said, we are very excited with this initiative, with this product.
 I mean, we had the first flight with the prototype, scale 1 to 3, a successful test, by the way.
 Now we are preparing the next test with the prototype scale one-to-one and technically
 is moving very well. We are planning the certification by 2025 and entering service in 2026. And
 about the negotiation with zanite I mentioned already,
 that's moving very well.
 Okay, very good.
 Now moving to business jets, we have a question from Credit Suisse.
 BusinessJet has been very strong, and on the first quarter results, you mentioned half
 of the deliverers were for first-time buyers in the second quarter, how much were first-time
 and buyers, maybe we can give an overview of the business jet market.
 I can do it. I would say today in our backlog, the portion of first time buyers, I would
 say is a third, something like 30%, in your backlog and delivery for the whole year, we
 We are talking about 30% first time buyers.
 and we are going with the market,
 if you see the industry.
 book to be between one to five to two to one, one to five to one and two to one to two.
 And we are, I would say, a little bit above that.
 and it's doing pretty well, but for sure the first buys
 pushing also the market especially in the light jets.
 category.
 Now there is a question on commercial from Credit Suisse.
 Your guidance for commercial deliverers of 45 to 50 seems low, given you have already
 We delivered 23 jets.
 Are there any supply chain issues that could prevent you from being above that range?
 Also, they are asking, what do you see in terms of delivers for 2022?
 any caller on that?
 say, uh, let's take it to account that commercial
 she's still suffering for the pandemic.
 what we are giving as the guidance to deliver this year is a little bit higher to the last
 this year. Last year we delivered 44 and for sure we are selling more but it's going
 to impact more 2022.
 and the fact that we deliver at 23 aircraft
 It's because it's well divided throughout the year.
 That's why the 47, I would say between 45 to 50 is the number we are having, and we
 We do see, I would say, around 30% for next year, between a 65 to 70 aircraft.
 But it has to be confirmed, but it's more or less the number you're seeing.
 It's important to mention.
 to reduce e-commerce or via e-share.
 We're coming back to historical levels at the Ember from 2033 onwards.
 We are selling more, but the sales counter we are closing right now is going to fulfill
 the skyline started in 2022 and 2021 is more or less the same level from 2020.
 If I'll allow me to make a link between this answer and the result of the company, it is
 It's true that in this first half of the year, comparing to the first half of last year,
 We did much better in terms of deliveries, in terms of results.
 the numbers speak by themselves.
 But if you look at the guides for the entire year,
 You see that, no, as planets.
 we won't see a huge increase in volumes
 in the commercial or executive.
 Yes, we are seeing some growth, moderate growth, this year compared to the last year, but the
 improvements in their results.
 I mean, either the EBIT coming from almost minus 3% last year
 to something between 3% and 4% this year.
 the free cash flow from minus 900 million last year to something between minus 150 this
 year.
 And this good performance is coming from
 Efficient games, pure efficient games.
 We really did a good right side in the organization.
 We are improving a lot of activities on cost reduction, on inventory reduction in all the
 company, you know, I mean, pushing sales for the future.
 So again, I mean, from next year on,
 I mean, we expect that with the stronger growth
 in the volumes, in all the business units,
 and with this more efficient and agile company,
 Then you see much better performance.
 So that's why our result is coming from this year,
 from efficiency gains from some additional sales, of course,
 but mailing from efficient gains.
 just to complete the question for supply change,
 what we are putting the guidance in, what we agreed with our customers for this year.
 at least for the commercial vehicle having not seen
 any supply chain I would say problems this year.
 We have several other questions.
 So the next one is related to margins and free cash flow.
 So the question is how do we see margins per business
 in the long term, and what sort of free cash flow conversion
 to be dying to free cash flow conversion.
 does Embryer expect?
 So, in regards to margin, we do see, let's, in a long-term perspective, we do see service
 and support the double-digit as it is today.
 we do see executive in the sense
 single-hard disk,
 And we are more or less even also today.
 And we do see the commercial aviation, I would say,
 a mid-single digit across between 3% to 5% in the long term.
 That's what we see in regards to profitability for the company and in regards to the cash
 the conversion from EBITDA to EBITDA,
 I would prefer to talk.
 we are seeing today, a 50% conversion from a bit to cash flow. We still need to improve
 something, but it's more or less the metrics I'm using internally. We do see today in the
 long run, 50% of their BIT being converted into cash for years to come.
 So, the next question is from JP Morgan, Marcelo Mota.
 Any updates?
 date on the sales campaigns for commercial aviation? Could we see more orders during the
 the second quarter.
 Yeah, good question. Yes, we have a lot of active sales campaigns ongoing, our commercial
 aviation. We just announced this sales for Sky West with 16 aircraft and yes, we have
 more to come.
 the sky west, it's not part of the backlog in Q2. We are going to book these 70 aircrafts
 in Q3.
 Aircraft, correct, aircraft, correct.
 Thank you, Nathaniel.
 There is a question here from Lucas, from Santander,
 talking about, you know, inflation. Can you please comment on how the company is seeing
 the raw material inflation,
 and how is the company offsetting these impacts?
 I would say we do see, in our final products, inflation, I would say, all index we have
 for suppliers between 2% to 3% for next year and to the customer side. We have also the
 real adjustment clause with the index, I would say.
 Our take-away for next year is a balance between what we have internally, inflation and the
 it pass through to the customer base.
 That's more or less what you are seeing,
 but there is, in some indicators,
 spike in deflation in the index for next year, that we are going to discuss with our customer
 base. Moreover, we do have, we did this year and we are doing this year and with that we
 We do have also a lot of design to value activities inside Embraer to reduce the base of the cost
 we have to be
 without any spectrum
 inflation or indicators
 Very good.
 So now, moving to new projects, there is a question from
 Rio Verde Investimentos, any updates on the partnerships for the TurboProp aircraft?
 That was a good question.
 well. This front is also moving very well, especially with the most, with the recent
 interest of U.S. airlines in that product.
 So we see that product as a good alternative for that market and other markets as well
 And also, as a preparation for new technology in the future.
 So we are very optimistic and working hard to accelerate this partnership front.
 Okay, I think we have at least one final question.
 It's back to commercial aviation.
 What do you expect?
 It's from WTS.
 what do you expect in the mid to long term
 commercial aviation as we are seeing recovering demand for flights and also
 renewal for having more sustainable fleets.
 Good question. Thank you.
 Again, we have, no, I mean, globally 94% of the Embraer fleet back in the skies in the
 The U.S., I mean, 97 percent of the invariant fleet is flying again.
 So it shows that the recovery in the domestic market really is coming.
 And that's why we are working in a lot of sales campaigns in that segment.
 you once, and E2s as well. So we are working hard to take advantage of this moment, as
 As Antonio mentioned, that we see volumes growing, I mean, in 2020, but strongly from
 2022 but strongly from 2023 onwards.
 I think a final question, it's related to defense.
 Can you please comment on the expectations for new KC390 orders?
 Well, as I said in the opening, we are working in many sales campaigns, for important sales
 campaigns for the KC tonight and also I mean we are working in the to develop
 partnerships that will help us to open new markets for that great aircraft.
 I think that that's what we had on the Q&A. So I think that concludes the Q&A.
 I want to thank you all for the questions and the time.
 So now
 But, Antonio Francisco, no comments?
 Okay, thank you all.
 Thanks a lot.
 So thanks for your interest in supporting our company.
 We are leaving a really special moment.
 As I said before, this year is the year of recovery,
 the year of turnaround and of rainbow hair
 in the numbers, as I said before,
 speaking by themselves,
 we expect to have a much better year in 2021
 compared to the last year, coming from a very tough crisis, as you know.
 And we hope to, you know, we expect to capture the new Embraer potential from, to grow from
 2021. So thank you very much for your support.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 So this concludes today's Q&A session.
 That, in turn, concludes Amber's second quarter 2021 financial results presentation.
 Thank you very much for your participation.

 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the MTN Ghana 2020 Annual Results Call.
 Please note that all participants are currently in listen-only mode.
 there will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference
 If you should need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by pressing star then 1, star then 0.
 Please note that this call is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremiah Opoku.
 Please go ahead, sir.
 Okay. Good afternoon, everyone. And I'd like to apologize for the long hold. The call operator had some technical problems. So let's begin the call. Apologies again.
 I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today to discuss MTN Gartner's annual results for the year ended 31st, December 2020.
 I'm Jeremiah Opoku, Investor Relations Manager for MTN Ghana.
 With me on the call today, I sell on my daddy home.
 CEO of MTN Ghana
 Kobna Benji Encho
 acting CFO of MCN Ghana
 and Tatu Mottlandi, Group Executive for Investor Relations.
 So Salom will speak about MTN's COVID initiatives and provide updates on some regulatory matters,
 after which he will delve into the company's annual performance and outlook.
 before we move on to the Q&A session,
 which will be facilitated by the call operator.
 Okay.
 I'll convey that over to you, Salom.
 Thank you very much, Jeremy, and good afternoon to everyone.
 and thank you for making the time to join us on this call today.
 I'd like to again
 you know,
 I apologize for the delay due to technical issues.
 We'll try to extend the call for a few minutes over to be able to accommodate the delay as a result of that.
 As mentioned, you know, we'll talk about our initiatives to support the fight against COVID-19
 and then update you
 on our operational performance
 as well as touch on some regulatory issues before looking at, you know, the outlook for 2021.
 In 2020, general economic and business performance was influenced by the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic,
 with devastating impacts across the globe.
 In Ghana, we experienced a significant contraction in the first half of the year, with some signs of improved economic activity in the second.
 Indeed, the impact of the pandemic has been felt by everyone,
 and many of us have loved ones who have been affected by COVID-19.
 MTN Ghana and our staff have also been impacted by COVID-19, notwithstanding the initiatives we put in place to ensure the safety of our people.
 On yesterday's data from the Ministry of Information, Ghana has had 81,245 confirmed cases,
 6,614 of which are still active, and 584, unfortunately, is there.
 For us at MTN Ghana, we have had a total of 138 of our staff who tested positive with COVID-19.
 we're thankful that 80 of those have since recovered
 although, sadly, one employee has passed on.
 Our thoughts are with the family of our lost colleagues and with the nation as we go through these tough times together.
 It's in light of these challenges that we at MTN launched our Yellow Hope Initiative
 to provide support to our people, our customers, our partners, and to the government of Ghana.
 In support of our customers, we zero-rated all more money P2P,
 peer-to-peer transfers
 up to a value of 100 Ghana cities per day from March 2020.
 This did not only save our customers over 94 million Ghana cities in fees,
 but also facilitated greater social distancing
 and deepen financial inclusion to increase the adoption of digital currency.
 We're happy to announce that this offer is still active.
 To further support government efforts, BMTN
 Ghana Foundation donated 5 million Ghana cities' worth of PPEs
 and other essentials of the government's COVID-19 Trust Fund
 for all-one distribution to frontline medical workers.
 We also deployed PPs and sanitizers, as well as ensured the adherence to all COVID-19 safety protocols across our branch network and offices.
 We'll continue to prioritize the safety of our customers and our people through this period and beyond.
 In supporting the efforts of government agencies,
 We zero-rated several public websites providing help and other COVID-19-related information.
 We also provided free access to over 200 websites for academic use by public and private educational institutions
 and committed to providing this until the end of the pandemic.
 MTN Ghana is supported with several other initiatives targeted at educational institutions, government agencies, and various ministries at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19, the details of which are included in the SEND's release document.
 In August 2020, we launched the BeWise campaign to encourage Gamians to wear their face masks
 and to wear them correctly.
 And this transitioned into MTN's global Where is For Me campaign
 to build awareness around the importance of correctly wearing a face mask to combat the spread of the virus.
 The fight against the pandemic continues into 2021, and MTN remains committed to provide an ongoing support to combat COVID-19.
 In January 2021, MTN Group announced a $25 million donation to support the African Union's COVID-19 vaccination program.
 The donation would help secure out to 7 million doses of the vaccine for health workers across the continent,
 contributing to the vaccination initiative of the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 MTN Ghana is pleased to play its part in this initiative to support the government of Ghana.
 As at the end of December 2020, the cumulative value of MTN Ghana's efforts to fight COVID-19 was 1 to the 9 million Ghana cities.
 As we progress through 2021, we will remain focused on supporting our people, our partners, and our customers
 while ensuring network resilience and efficiency
 in delivering on our quest to make the lives of our customers a whole lot brighter.
 I will now turn to operational results for the year 2020.
 We're pleased with our overall performance in a very challenging period.
 We had good growth in our subscriber base, which was helped by the heightened need for reliable and resilient data and digital services in this era of the pandemic.
 To help maintain the quality and availability of service for our data and mobile money customers,
 We invested 1.5 billion Ghana CDs in network capacity and infrastructure expansion.
 as part of this
 we rolled out 200 2G, 200 3G, and 950 LTE sites,
 which helped relieve the pressure on our infrastructure
 and significantly enhance our service delivery across the nation.
 A smart topic deployment helps support a 105% growth in data traffic and reach 1.875 total 4G sites nationwide.
 That's 1,825 total scores.
 I've made it now.
 This is related to a 71.7 4G population coverage,
 and we're committed to our mission of having FOLU in every site in the coming years.
 Service revenue growth remained in the double digits, expanding by 16.4% year-of-year, driven by good growth in voice, data, and mobile money and digital.
 Voice revenue grew by 8.1% year-on-year and was supported by a 23.4% increase in our subscriber base,
 as well as various customer value management initiatives, which help manage churn and improve usage.
 The contribution to service revenue from voice continues to decline, reaching 41.8% from 45% in the year prior.
 as other services increase their contribution in line with our strategy to diversify our revenue.
 Growth in data revenue was strong at 21.3% year-on-year.
 This was due to growth in our active data subscribers by 32.4%,
 a higher number of smartphones on the network, and a general increase in usage.
 As mentioned earlier, the higher usage was partly due to shifts in consumer behavior
 brought about by the pandemic and enhanced network infrastructure.
 Data revenue contribution to service revenue increased from 28.4% to 29.6% year-on-year.
 Bull money revenue grew by, I think, at 2.2% year-on-year, as the number of active users increased by 16.3%.
 This was the result of various promotions in the year, increased P2P transactional activity,
 and the offer of more advanced services such as retail merchant payments
 and international remissances.
 In line with our revenue diversification strategy,
 low-money revenue contribution
 to service revenue rose from 18.6% to 21.2% year-on-year.
 Digital revenue declined by 6.2% year-on-year.
 This was due to the impact of applying a principal versus agent accounting standard across the MTN group in 2020, with zero impact on the bottom line.
 For a like-for-like comparison, digital revenue would have grown by 34.5% year-on-year.
 We've come a long way in our digital journey,
 and we're pleased to report a 3-8% surge in the number of active subscribers
 or into some enhancements in our video and gaming offerings made during the period.
 We also observe the increased adoption of our MyMTN and our Yova Super Apps,
 And we intend to employ strategies to continue this growth.
 Digital revenue contribution to service revenue declined accordingly from 3.9% to 3.1% year-on-year.
 Our reported earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization grew by 20.8%
 with a corresponding margin expansion of 1.9 percentage points to 52.7%.
 We continue to manage our costs efficiently and benefited from OPEX reductions arising
 from COVID-19 impact and digital distribution efficiency.
 This resulted in healthy expansion of our EBITDA and EBITDA margins.
 The overall improvement in our revenue lines, coupled with our prudent cost management and efficiency,
 resulted in a 38.4% growth in profit after tax.
 And after reviewing the full-year performance,
 We have recommended a final dividend of Ghana CD 0.05 per share.
 So, that's $5 per Swiss per share.
 bringing a total dividend for 2020 to $8.99 per share.
 This represents 70.5% of profit after tax and a 33.3% increase in dividend per share compared to 2019.
 I will now touch on some regulatory updates.
 Key ones would be the SMP and localization.
 In terms of S&P, we continue to have productive and constructive engagement with our regulators and our policy makers.
 However, due to the elections in December and the ongoing veteran appointments of the
 state, we'll see in the next couple of weeks.
 ministries. These discussions
 have stalled since late November to early December.
 We're optimistic that we'll continue these discussions to influence the implementation of the remedies to achieve SMP going forward.
 Our primary objective is to ensure that the remedies that are implemented have a long
 change.
 And that's what we're doing.
 Thank you.
 impact on this
 question of
 of the industry.
 In terms of localizations, we're committed to continue to progress localization
 to achieve the 25% localization target agreed with the government of Ghana.
 In December last year, December 2020, we launched an employee share options program,
 which is committing an additional 4.41% towards localization.
 So that brings our total percent localization to 16.9, of which 12.5% was as a result of
 the IPO in September 2018, and the 4.41 additional commitment from the Employee Share Option
 program in December last year.
 We'll update you subsequently on the plans to achieve the remainder of the localization
 as we go through the year.
 In terms of mobile money, Payments, Systems, and Services Act,
 The localization requirement to achieve a 30% localization by the end of December 2020 has also been revised.
 The central bank has recently informed us by extending the timeline from December 2020 to January 2022.
 We continue to work with our advisors in developing the plans to be able to execute this plan
 to achieve the set targets of 30% localization for the modal money limited entity, a wholly
 and subsidiary of Scam.com PLC.
 We look forward to providing further updates on our progress in subsequent releases.
 Just a quick update on MTN Ghana's 25th anniversary.
 The year 2021 marks a significant milestone in the journey of MTN Ghana's contribution
 to providing vital telecommunication and digital services in Ghana.
 as part of our 25th anniversary
 were committing the equivalent of 25 million U.S. dollars,
 which is approximately
 winded in 15 million Ghana cities
 to a fund supporting Ghana's post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.
 MTN Ghana would also work to deepen its strategic partnership with the government of Ghana
 through investments in digital ecosystem projects
 as part of the government's long-term transformation agenda.
 We're excited about this development and grateful to our customers and stakeholders for their support.
 More details will be shared as discussions and agreements progress with government and our partners.
 In terms of the outlook, the outlook for 2021 will be shaped by the extended impact of the pandemic.
 While economic growth projections by entities such as the World Bank and the IMF are optimistic,
 We remain cautious due to the potential longer-term dampening effect of COVID-19 on the Ghana economy.
 As a business, we remain focused on our people, on our customers, and on supporting government
 through the provision of a resilient network to support economic growth.
 We continue to target service revenue growth within our guidance range of 13% to 15%.
 and employ prudent cost strategies to continue to improve our margins
 and further ensure growth in our bottom line.
 MTN Ghana will continue to prioritize its investments in infrastructure expansion
 to meet the needs of Ghanaians in this era of accelerated digitalization.
 Continued growth in service revenue would largely be driven by data,
 more of financial services and digital.
 In 2021, we will continue our journey from a traditional mobile telecoms operator
 to an emerging digital operator.
 We're therefore designated 2021 as the year of the customer, the digital experience.
 I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers.
 Thank you very much.
 Ladies and gentlemen, at this stage, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then one now.
 If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star and then 2.
 Again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and then one.
 The first question we have is from John Kim from UBS.
 Yes.
 Hi, everybody.
 Thank you for the opportunity.
 the two unrelated questions, please.
 Firstly,
 cash flow to the group level
 We should be thinking about the management fee as well as the dividend.
 And on the dividend calcs, we should be using about 83%, if I heard you correctly, of the collective dividend up to group question mark.
 Second question, I know that there's been some legal process around MTN Ghana being declared dominant.
 That's done and dusted, and have you seen any remedies or do you know of ones to come?
 Thank you.
 Okay, thank you for your question.
 Can you just clarify the very first question about the cash flow group?
 I wasn't sure if it was just a statement or a question.
 and I wasn't quite sure what the question itself was.
 my understanding is that
 Ghana pays a management fee to a group, and it's also entitled to a share of the dividend at the Ghanaian level.
 and my understanding
 from what you said earlier is that
 That's about an 83% ownership.
 Okay.
 So what was the question?
 Do you want us to clarify that?
 Because you've restated the facts and it's correct.
 I'm not sure what exactly the question is.
 Hi. Sorry. Can you quantify that for us?
 in either rants, CD, or dollars, please.
 Okay. On the total dividends plus management fee paid up to group.
 Please.
 All right.
 So I'll hand that question over to Coby, who's the active in CF.
 But before Kobi comes in, let me just answer the question on SMP.
 and yet
 you know
 You know, MTN was declared a significant market power, market player in July 2020.
 and as soon as there have been a number of
 development at this stage
 in October 2020, we implemented one of the seven remedies that were imposed on us,
 and which was a 30% reduction in asymmetric interconnect rate.
 and we continue to have dialogue and discussions with the regulators
 while we look at the implementation of the remaining six remedies.
 Our primary objective is to get to a point where the remedies that are implemented
 have a long-term impact on the sustainability of the industry.
 It's really important because that would ensure that the objectives of S&P are met broadly.
 as opposed to a reduction in MTNs performance-based
 but, you know, minimal impact on the industry.
 So that's really what the discussions are about.
 And the engagement so far have been encouraging.
 However, you know, it stalled to some degree following the election in December
 and the ongoing process to appoint the Substantive Minister for Communications and Digital.
 So once that process is concluded, we'll be able to resume discussions and progress,
 And we'll be able to give you an update at the next quarterly investor call.
 thank you
 I'll hand over to Kobe now to give you the numbers and the details
 for their dividend and management
 and she can get up to great things.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, this is...
 This is Corby.
 for
 dividend and
 for dividend
 and the
 the
 The management fee that we expect to pay, it comes up to 949 million Ghana CDs.
 We are paying dividend of $840 thereabouts and management fee of $268 million.
 Okay, helpful. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Mayur and Rajaratnam from MUPFA.
 hi guys
 And thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 The first question is about the interconnect traffic regulations and SMP.
 we saw that the
 voice revenue increase
 wasn't great actually
 was a decrease of some sort in the
 fourth quarter, if I get
 my numbers right
 How much of the asymmetric cut is part of this?
 or is it purely just customer behavior
 or was there an additional competitive pressure
 or anything like that
 because you added subscribers.
 because I'm just trying to understand what are the dynamics behind this.
 some colour would be useful
 and the second question is
 excluding your
 wonderful product in wireless broadband
 fixed broadband
 um
 What's the average data usage in megabytes per customer?
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Well, thank you very much.
 Let me start with the average, you know, data usage of a customer.
 and we're currently seeing
 somewhere between 3.5 gigs
 per customer per month
 to somewhere around 4 gigs per customer per month.
 And so that's the average that consumers are using.
 And, obviously, that number has increased during the year based on the demand for data and digital services as a result of COVID-19.
 Now, the question you asked on voice,
 Yes, the voice trend.
 If we look at the voice trend quarter on quarter for 2020, you would see a decline from Q1 into Q4.
 However, the kill-for trend is actually a bit of an anomaly because there's some one-time adjustment effects that are taking place.
 So, you know, that trickles up to the top-line revenue as well, if you look at the year-on-year
 revenue.
 In terms of voice, just to give you some comfort, what we're seeing in Q1, at least in January
 so far with double-digit growth year-on-year for the month.
 So, again, just to put that number into context, there were some one-off adjustments, you know,
 interconnects was related to that.
 And then the second component, which is not a one-time, but a permanent adjustment, will be the S&P.
 However, the NP effect is less than 1% of total revenue.
 with about 0.6%.
 And so that effect is not just the most significant driver of the trend we're seeing.
 So we would expect to come back to our normal trends around late single visits to early double visits as far as the voice growth year-on-year goes.
 great
 Just to come back on the data usage per subscriber, is that three-and-a-half to four gigs per mobile subscriber,
 or if that also contains in the denominator your fixed wireless LTE product as well.
 or just one for clarification.
 No, it's a mobile.
 Oh, that's pretty good.
 Thank you so much.
 Thank you.
 the next question we have is from
 Christians and Odaya from
 NetBank.
 Hi everyone. Congratulations on the results and thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 I've got two quick ones.
 I think a bit of it has been onset.
 But just on your Q4 operating metrics, so, you know, your revenue and EBITDA, it seems to have slowed down in the last quarter.
 Now I know you're on the last question, on Mayurian's question, you mentioned that there
 there were some one-off adjustments.
 Was there anything else that was causing the slowdown?
 because you know
 up until september it was looking pretty strong uh both in terms of like i said revenue and margins but
 quarter four looks quite weak and a huge slowdown um and then the second question if i can um i know
 you guys announced
 to buy back off 1.1 million shares in December.
 And I think this had like a deadline to get KYC for the subscribers done by the 23rd, which was about two days ago.
 Is there any update on that on how much you guys have to do
 and how that impacts your overall localization to get to 25%?
 Thanks.
 Okay.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 Let me take the first question, and I'll have Kobe answer the question on the buyback
 and what the implications are for localization.
 So in terms of the first question, I think, you know,
 You've got two effects.
 When you look at the overall performance,
 You mentioned revenue and EBITDA.
 I believe that the answer I gave, you know,
 previously on the revenue side should
 satisfy the revenue trend.
 However, if you look at the EBITDA trend as well, you know, there was some impact and, you know, an appearance of a slowdown.
 The reason for that is
 primarily
 one
 once we had
 easing up
 is an app of supply chains.
 We're able to accelerate
 we'll better accelerate
 our CapEx deployment, and that has a direct
 impact on our
 EBITDA. So for the previous quarter, because of that slowdown, we're not as aggressive in capital
 spend as we would normally be
 And a lot of that capex ended up being spent in Q4.
 So that's the explanation for the bottom line size.
 My previous answer should hopefully address the revenue side of that as well.
 Organically, we don't need to do that.
 Oh, sorry.
 on the
 on the buy box
 it's
 it's due to KYC issues as you are aware. We've managed this process with the regulator so we are
 are going through the process of updating the kyc's of the related part uh parties uh we've gotten to
 the end of the process where the outstanding ones will be
 What?
 and sold onto the market again.
 so that is the position yeah it has no effect on the 12.5 percent because that one is locked
 per the IPO, initial IPO that we had, that number is locked.
 It doesn't have any impact on that.
 Colby, I mean, can you give us an indication of how many of that 1.1 million share of subscribers have actually done their KYC?
 So is the impact going to be a lot less than the 1.1?
 At the last check of it, it's 1,420 potential shareholders have updated their records in that.
 Okay.
 All right.
 Thank you very much, gentlemen.
 you're welcome
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Jonathan Kennedy Good from J.P. Morgan.
 I wanted to come back to your revenue guidance of 13% to 15%.
 You mentioned that voice was growing double-digit so far this year,
 The other lines are all growing, you know, 20% north of that.
 So just trying to understand why the conservative guidance,
 Is there, you know, potentially more competitive pressure on the voice horizon given changes in termination rates?
 And then second question, just on your digital revenue, could you tell us how many IOBA users you actually have
 and what kind of revenue opportunities you see in there,
 whether that's starting to scale somewhat.
 Okay.
 All right, let me just try to give some context, first of all, on the voice side.
 Yes, we're seeing, you know,
 double-digit voice growth so far this year.
 It's one month in the year.
 However, what I said before was that we expect on the year,
 voice growth year on year, somewhere between the
 high single digits to the early double digits, right?
 Voice is something like 40%, 41% of total revenue.
 So a single-digit, late single-digit to early double-digit year-on-year growth will pull down the bulk of the total revenue.
 So that's the first reason why the, you know, the estimators are taken to 50%.
 The second component is that, you know, one, SMP deployment or remedy implementation has only started.
 So there'll be some incremental impact of SMP, depending on where we land with the ministry,
 which while a new development
 before we gave our estimate of 13 to 15.
 we've maintained the estimates of 13 to 15 despite the impact,
 the incremental impact of some of the S&P measures.
 And so I think, you know, it's a reasonable assessment of where we believe we'll land by the end of the year.
 In terms of IOBA users, we ended last year over 700,000 IOBA users.
 And in terms of revenue today, I mean, we're not really generating revenue from Ioba.
 where it's a platform strategy that we have in mind.
 And Uber is intended to be a super app.
 So at this stage, it's really driving adoption and building a usage behavior.
 and monetization will be at another stage.
 And so for now, revenue is not a primary focus.
 We're just building a base so that we can expand on the platform capabilities of Ayoba as part of our long-time strategy.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Samil Rajkopoul from HSBC.
 Please go ahead.
 hi
 I just wanted to check
 on the
 regulatory development.
 I mean, in fact, I know
 you know, some, uh, some, some, uh,
 new positions are made right now
 and what is your take
 through the discussions that are ongoing with the regulator.
 and do you expect any more new rules coming up on this regard?
 Okay.
 Okay. Thanks for your question.
 I think the first thing to point out is that there were seven remedies that were
 that were imposed at the time of, you know,
 sending out the SMP and
 designation, and
 And of those, only one has been implemented.
 While our discussions have been encouraging,
 We would expect, you know, a few more to be implemented through the year.
 What we're focused on currently in our engagement is really the implementation,
 the definition of those specific remedies to ensure that the broader objective of SMP
 he's achieved.
 And, you know, those discussions, like I said, have stalled since the elections.
 and once the substantive minister is put in place,
 We will resume those discussions and progress to a point where we can give you something
 more specific probably at the next quarterly update.
 But for now, we've implemented the one, which is 30% reduction in asymmetric interconnects.
 and we'll continue to monitor that as we go forward.
 And maybe if I can just follow up, I mean, what would you think, Rodney,
 the implications would be given that the government
 is planning to
 acquire or propose to acquire
 one of these smaller operators there so what kind of potential implications views or see there from
 on that moment.
 Okay.
 It's a very difficult question to answer because there has really been very little shared on this acquisition by government of S.L. Tegel.
 Now, just to point out, typically in a situation where there's an acquisition from a buyer,
 you would understand
 the investment appetite
 to the ambition of a new buyer, if it's really, you know, just to hold the same position,
 if it's really to challenge for number one, number two, if it's really to build skill.
 And based on that understanding,
 would be able to model a potential impact.
 At this point, the only thing that has been shared
 is the fact that government's interest is to ensure that jobs are secured and jobs are saved.
 However, on the business side, there has been no indication of the ambition
 and no indication of the potential investment strategy of a potential new buyer.
 And we also understand that government's role may be just to hold and attract new investors.
 So we're still at a very early stage as far as what the outcome of this process would look like.
 and based on that would have a much more concrete sense of the impact.
 So I apologize.
 I'm here to give you a real sense.
 but we continue to monitor this
 And to the extent that we can share thoughts and impacts, we will.
 Sure, thank you.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Nick Padgett from Frontura Capital.
 Hello, and again, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.
 I again want to
 Apologies, I again want to ask about revenue that some of the other questioners have asked about.
 And undoubtedly, in total, it was a great year for 2020.
 But as others have mentioned
 And, you know, Q4, the revenue pace was a little softer.
 And I've heard everything you've said so far, but I saw a few, you know, uncertainties about the Q4 number.
 So, you know, my observation is that sequentially, if we look at the two prior years, you know, going back to 2018, Q4 revenue was 15 percent higher than Q3.
 And in 2019, it was 9% higher.
 but this year
 It was basically flat.
 Um,
 I heard you say there were some one offs, but that would be quite a bit of one off to, you know, be that to explain all of that difference.
 So I wonder, is there something else, like,
 You know,
 COVID really, I think, helped your revenue in the first three quarters.
 could it be that things are normalizing
 and so
 the slower growth
 is a result of the normalization.
 Although your guidance, you know, as mentioned, is sort of unchanged.
 So that maybe is counter to that point.
 Or was there just anything else unique about Q4 other than the one-offs,
 or maybe the one-offs were bigger than I thought.
 I'm just still looking for some additional kind of clarity on that, if you could explain Q4.
 Sure.
 Let me start by saying if we normalize the effects for the adjustments that were made, Q4 over Q3 would have been about a 9% year-on-year growth.
 They would have been in line with 2019, as you mentioned.
 So that's a statin point, right?
 and if I take the second
 points or are we seeing
 a change in trend
 from a consumer behavior standpoint?
 The answer is yes.
 I mean, we're seeing a lot more people using data and digital as far as, you know,
 the pandemic goes
 things and behaviors
 from, you know, people going to physical school and now at home working.
 but if I look at the
 Q1 to Q4 trends.
 It doesn't suggest that there is a specific issue, right?
 If we look at what happened in Q4, most of our schools went back,
 and therefore the usage of data from home would have gone down,
 but that will be compensated for by, you know, other behaviors.
 So there's quite a lot going on in terms of shifts in behavior, and once the easing of the restrictions start to unfold, those behavior changes that we saw in Q2, Q3 would be reversed as well.
 So there's quite a lot of mix going on.
 But organically, yes, we're seeing a slower growth in voice than we're seeing for the other areas, which is expected, but not to the extent that the numbers will depict here, because if we normalize, we're seeing something like a 9% June-year growth.
 Okay.
 9% sequential
 From Q3 to Q4
 X-ray one-off.
 OK, so that's thank you for clarifying that.
 That's more than I would have guessed.
 And maybe you said that number at the beginning, and I missed it.
 Yeah, no problem.
 So what, I mean, given that is such a large number, what kind of one-offs, what kind of adjustments would these be?
 I guess that it clarifies one answer and then raises a new question of just what are those?
 I wouldn't have guessed that kind of one-offs could occur.
 Sure.
 so outside of
 outside of SMP
 and those interconnects
 and there was also a principal agent adjustment on the digital side
 that affected the overall Twiddle business.
 And perhaps we can go offline and go into a bit more detail on this if you would like.
 the finance team can work you through this.
 Okay.
 But those are the two areas that we made the adjustments.
 Okay.
 um
 were these
 So I'm going to ask this because I think it's it's on my mind and probably others.
 And I understand you probably won't give me a, won't be able to answer it, but I'll just ask anyway for the benefit of everyone.
 You know, sometimes we see when a company has a great nine months, you know, they take the foot off the accelerator bit and they still report a very good year.
 or, you know, discretionary items that don't necessarily have to be recognized are recognized in Q4.
 And so I just can't help wondering if that's the case of maybe the Q4 you reported is a bit of a low aberration
 because you could still have a great year anyway, and that just, you know,
 set you up for, you know, another good
 growth year next year.
 no it's a creative question but no the answer is no
 So, you know, we had to make these adjustments.
 and
 which you'd see on the evening out of these through the year.
 So, okay.
 Well, fair enough.
 Thank you for answering.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you.
 The next question we have is from Ali Nasir from Burgers.
 Thank you for the opportunity.
 I just have questions around MoMA, please.
 maybe starting with the structure of any potential transaction
 that takes local ownership to 30% by the new timeline.
 I'm just curious, how do you ensure that the interests of NTN Ghana shareholders are not only protected but maximized in case of a transaction?
 and how do you do, you know, what kind of transaction options do you foresee to get to 30%?
 Okay.
 so at this point
 I mean, it's, you know, it's a bit early for us to tell.
 however
 what I can see is if you look at
 just can't come level,
 How come is that?
 hope you own some, you know,
 more money limited to hold you on subsidiaries
 council.
 Therefore, if we're able to achieve the 25% of ScanCom and split the shareholders across
 small money
 limited
 we would
 have achieved
 25% of the 30.
 So the question you're asking really applies to the 5% self-loss above the 25%.
 and we haven't
 We find a structure for that as yet.
 but just to sort of
 explain the component
 of the 30% that will be impacted by
 a question, it would be the safest
 and that remains.
 And, you know, once we make progress on this, we'll share that with you.
 But again,
 That's the interest of the shareholders.
 It's really good.
 in the interest of
 shareholder will absolutely be taken into consideration for effect which has
 and, you know, things like that.
 I'm sure that's where the question is going.
 Yeah, no, but I didn't even think about
 indirect
 So that's really helpful.
 just on that point
 the ESOP
 Will that need to vest in 2021 for it to count as local shares, or does it have a longer vest duration?
 so it has a longer
 are best in duration.
 So there are two components there in about three years to five years.
 So, okay.
 so you would
 you would
 recognize the local, I guess
 he'd recognize these chairs as they vest
 in terms of, as they count as local shares, right?
 that's right
 but the
 The adaptation was made.
 No, no, I don't want to.
 and reserved.
 would be
 that would become real jazz
 It's one of the best, yes.
 Thank you, thank you.
 Great.
 And just operationally on Momo,
 the monetization
 has been
 really impressive
 if you look at this
 rather than the average user.
 Can you just talk about some of the initiatives that you've put in place this year
 or whether consumers have changed the way they use normal that have driven that monetization.
 And then the second part to that question is,
 I've noticed that the subscriber growth in Momo has lagged voice and data in the year.
 And I was wondering, you know,
 What do you think is preventing faster adoption and penetration among your voice users?
 Okay.
 I think a way to think about that, let me just start with the growth in Momo.
 You know, both Momo and Data have about the same number of active users, you know, 10.7, 10.8.
 So the difference is not really significant.
 If you really think about the need for data versus the need for Momo in a year like we've just had,
 And then it's actually quite impressive that Momo is keeping the same,
 is keeping pace
 with data growth in terms of subscribers.
 Well, I think, you know, we may have under-indexed in data in previous years.
 Everyone may have done better, which is why you've seen a slight difference in the percentages.
 but if you look at the actual numbers
 Momo and active data are exactly
 the same using the NPM definition
 which for me suggests that Momo is actually doing quite well.
 So, that's a fair point.
 In terms of monetization, a number of things have happened.
 One, we've increased SERPs by about 60%, but we've also seen a significant increase in usage in average transactions per user.
 and it's really important
 because if you look at other markets that are, you know,
 Machu, Kenya, for example,
 the biggest driver of
 Apple growth is increased frequency of transaction, and two, increased frequency of transactions
 across a broader base of subproducts within the more money suite.
 So when we think about advanced services, things like our loan products,
 international remittances, payment services.
 is those new products allow users to have a higher level of stickiness
 and subsequently a higher level of usage per user per month.
 So we've seen, you know, significant growth there, upwards of five transactions per month.
 Last year, we were sort of around the 4 to 4.5.
 So it's, you know, a 20%, 30% increase in usage frequency as well.
 So those are the primary drivers.
 And as we continue to expand our product portfolio, we should continue to see these usage frequencies increase over the coming year as well.
 That's great, and that's also in the context of zero rating on the 100 study, that kind of growth.
 That's correct, yeah.
 That's great.
 Right, okay.
 Just on that point, Salon, if you don't mind,
 as of
 and if you look forward
 that, or maybe just looking at 2020,
 I mean, how did this fit out between peer-to-peer and some of the new products that are, you know, more sticky in nature?
 Sure.
 So if I take our advanced services in total, we're talking sort of 12% to 15% in terms of percent of revenue.
 So, you know, they're still growing as far as the product mix is concerned.
 and the level of adoption there is also still growing.
 but if we think of the future
 you know, advanced services
 really represents the future of moral money
 because the basic transactions,
 P2P cash in cash out
 will start to normalize in terms of incremental growth.
 So for us, it's really building the foundations for the future
 and making sure we get that mix right
 so that we can continue to sustain the growth as we go forward.
 So that's really their response to that.
 Great. Last one just on this is just related to the float size, which you saw on the balance sheet.
 I think you've exceeded a billion dollars.
 It's about doubled versus the 2019 December close.
 and I calculate that, I don't know if this is the right way of doing it,
 But if you look at kind of an average wallet size, it's now over 100 U.S. dollars, about 107.
 and I was just wondering
 is consistent with what you observe
 or am I looking at things, you know, from an accounting basis?
 because that seems like a big number for Ghana in the wallet size.
 Sure.
 I think the first thing
 to note is that the float covers a couple of different areas.
 It covers our merchants.
 It covers our consumers and it covers our agents.
 And, you know, I believe sort of the bank flood may be part of that as well.
 So it's hard to take that number and just divide it by the number of customers and get the wallet size.
 yeah
 That's what I thought.
 Okay.
 That's helpful.
 Well, thank you for that clarification.
 you're welcome
 Thank you.
 So we have a few more questions on the conference call.
 do you have time to take
 a few
 Yeah, hi. Maybe we can ask a few more questions, and then we can end the call.
 Not a problem.
 This is from Darren's.
 from 337 Frontier Capital.
 Hi.
 Hi, good afternoon, good morning.
 And congrats on the great results.
 A couple of questions for me.
 Could you just talk about the growth in both voice and data you're seeing?
 do you have any indication
 If these are market share gains, is the market growing as quickly as you guys?
 And could you talk a little bit about sort of any kind of pushback from your two competitors?
 it sounds like
 as you said, Tego and
 that's a bit more complicated
 but I'm just
 Any update on competition would be helpful.
 also
 So the 139 million CDs that you guys booked as related to sort of COVID
 initiatives. I'm assuming that's
 on the income statement and
 is it fair to assume that a lot of that
 comes out in 2021 or are these
 going to be
 recurring expenses
 And then the last question, I just want to confirm, you said the advanced services in Momo is around 12% to 13% of revenue.
 last year
 I think you guys were closer to maybe 2% or 3% in that line.
 And am I right in saying that?
 And can you just unpack that a little bit?
 where is the
 where's the
 the growth and that advanced
 services coming from.
 It sounds like you guys are gaining good momentum there.
 Okay, thanks for the question.
 Let me start with advanced services.
 and last year
 We're just around 10%, not 3%.
 So we've seen something like a, you know,
 40% to 50% growth in that
 line in terms of the
 percent of more money revenue.
 so that's just to clarify
 and the numbers you have.
 And the growth is really coming from payments where, you know,
 we've continued to expand the number of merchants we had.
 we came out of last year with about
 $130,000
 in the next
 and it's the end of this year.
 we ended this year with over
 170,000 mentions
 and we continue to see increased activity at various merchant points.
 So the expansion of the merchants increases your ability to use and your opportunity to use your mobile money wallet.
 and in the year of the pandemic where
 There have been a lot of restrictions and things like that.
 that has also accelerated and helped accelerate the change in behavior.
 And can I ask
 the
 relationship
 that MTM group announced
 with MasterCard.
 Is that being implemented in Ghana as well?
 Is that a good one?
 that's a global view for us
 So, yes, it will have an implication for Ghana as well.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Now, your second question was, you know, the $159 million.
 Just to break it down, this is the COVID impact for us in terms of what we've spent in cash,
 but also what we've given up in revenue.
 so the 139
 includes a 94 million
 of P2P for More Money Limited
 and the balance of that would be what we spend in cash,
 which would show up in our income statements.
 So, yes, we've continued the P2P, the free P2P 400 Ghana CVs daily.
 We've continued that so far in 2021.
 and in terms of the spend, we will continue to spend on COVID
 until we get to a point where we don't have a need to.
 So these numbers will be baked into 2021 as well.
 Got it.
 Now, the first question was on voice and data
 and if we're seeing market share growth.
 You know, I think in voice, you know, market share has been marginally growing, but it's fairly flat.
 But in terms of data, we've seen some market share growth.
 Unfortunately, we haven't had a recent release from the NCAI regulator on the industry position,
 And the numbers we have are quite old.
 So until we receive that, it's hard to give a very concrete sense of whether we're seeing
 market sharing data or not.
 I know all the operators, as an industry, there was a surge in demand for data.
 And therefore, to the extent that you're able to provide a capacity, you would see growth, especially during the COVID period.
 So I would expect that, you know, market share may have grown marginally in data
 or will remain about flux in load.
 There would have been an entire industry effect from COVID-19.
 Got it.
 And sorry, just one.
 please go ahead
 No, no, you continue on.
 No, I was just going to say, in terms of competition, I mean, the dynamics in the marketplace have been linked to the acquisition or the exit of Airtel and potentially Melecom from the market.
 Like I said before, we don't have enough detail to really ascertain and assess what this means for our business going forward.
 And as soon as we have more information, we'll be able to share that.
 Our focus continues to be ensuring that we invest smartly.
 continue to focus on resilience
 and quality of service
 and we're also expanding our technology so that we can have 4G on every site in the coming years,
 And that continues to be our focus and also build out our home network
 and where we see a lot of opportunity in the future.
 can i just one related question on competition in mobile money i mean are you seeing is there any
 competitive response there
 I mean, you guys, my understanding...
 I mean, the bit of digging I can do to try to understand sort of the distribution
 and agent network for Vodacom and Airtel Tego, I mean, it seems very, very limited.
 I mean are they
 even trying in mobile money at this point
 or is the game yours right now?
 No, it absolutely is or not.
 And, you know,
 that for us
 if you think about
 mobile money today,
 I mean, you know, we're talking by the MTN definition about 10 million customers.
 we have a population of about
 30, 32, 31 million.
 So, I mean, that's only 30% of the total population
 from an active more money user penetration standpoint.
 From that perspective, I mean, I think there is a lot of opportunity to continue to drive
 financial inclusion, you know,
 But if you look at the frequency of transactions, it's still in single digits, where we should be in double digits.
 Now, to really get to double digits, you need an industry ecosystem maturity that allows that to happen, for which we would need the other players in the market to continue to drive behaviors towards electronic currency, more money currency, things like that.
 So, to an extent, at this stage of the game, any effort from our competitors would help
 accelerate the growth in the industry because it's at such a nascent stage.
 I mean, even though you've seen
 float numbers of $6 billion and above, I mean, we're at a very, very young stage in terms
 of the more money opportunity.
 So we don't see growth from our competitors as compromising the pie.
 we really see it as accelerating the growth of the pie,
 and we can have a much larger share of that growth in terms of, you know,
 but in terms of the growth of the pie,
 we can have a much larger share of that incremental growth.
 And so we encourage it.
 We also do think there is an innovation engine that's lacking in the marketplace.
 and some of the initiatives from the central bank to try to license these smaller players,
 all of that will continue to drive innovation within the ecosystem
 to allow us to reach the maturity that we require to continue to grow faster.
 So a lot of opportunity.
 I mean, we don't see that as negative at all.
 We would encourage more people to invest because it drives the whole market.
 There's still 90% of cash usage in Ghana at the moment, despite the pandemic and all of that.
 So there's a lot of work to be done.
 And if we all bring our energies together as an industry, we'll get the ecosystem to grow, and we'll be able to all benefit from that.
 Got it.
 All right.
 Thanks so much, and congrats again on the great results.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you. Final question is from Brad Buritsky from Equinox Partners.
 We'll be right back.
 Thank you for giving me the chance to ask a question.
 I have two questions.
 the first is
 In the comments, you talk about investing a billion and a half CD in network expansion, whereas the CapEx for the year is roughly around a billion.
 So I assume that the incremental half a billion CDs came out of the income statement.
 I'm curious sort of what part of network expansion you capitalize and what part you expense.
 And then the second question is, so you talk about 2021 being the year of the digital or year of digitalization.
 What specific initiatives are you doing around that, and what is that?
 So in the last part of your question, you sort of dropped off.
 If you can just start from the year of the customer and what initiatives.
 yeah
 What specific initiatives are you doing around that this year?
 and what is it?
 What does it really mean to be the year of the digital customer?
 Okay.
 All right, so I'll take the second question,
 and Kobi will answer the question on the CAPEX
 where we look at the core cupcakes versus the rest,
 You can give me the details there.
 But let me start with the year of the customer.
 So when we talk about the year of the customer there,
 A number of different things that we look at.
 We have about six pillars that we've developed in terms of digitizing our business.
 And, you know, one of them is, you know, operations internally trying to automate and digitize a lot of our process internally.
 a lot of us are working from home now
 And therefore, it's not only a good to have or a nice to have, but it's a need to have so that we can continue to work effectively and support the business.
 So that's the first component, and I won't dwell too much on what that means,
 but we can go into the details there.
 The second one is really on our product side, where today we looked at some of the initiatives we've launched.
 We've gone from using scratch cards, you know, 15%, 20% of our recharge sales came from scratch cards two years ago,
 and we've dropped that to about 5% last year
 and we're saying we're going to get to zero by the end of this year.
 And, again, that's part of digitizing our sales channel, our primary sales channel on Recharge,
 where you have newer channels that can support that transaction.
 So you have my MTN app, for example.
 we have
 you know
 electronic
 electronic sales of recharge
 as far as agent goes.
 And you have these sort of different channels that you can purchase, reach out from.
 You'd have online channels as well, website channels and things like that.
 When we think about becoming a platform player in the next three to five years,
 then the foundation for that is really being built from our perspective around open API for mobile money,
 where we can have, you know, customers accessing our APIs
 and connecting to us, you know, without having, you know,
 significant interaction with us looking at our ioba super app which
 started off as a messaging app, but we're looking at implementing micro-apps.
 So if you think of WeChat,
 in Asia. That's really what
 ioba looks like and so currently
 we have about six or seven micro-apps
 already implemented, and we'll
 continue to expand on that, looking at
 you know, relevant local apps that can sit within the Ioba ecosystem
 and continue to expand that.
 So it's a very exciting time for us.
 We're bringing a lot of things together.
 We see ourselves as, you know, sort of a central player where we can be the core of a lot of these transactions.
 and the
 innovation from the startup industry
 can be on the outside of that core and connect to that core
 to be able to provide their services to get at the end.
 When we think about customer experience,
 There is a lot of opportunity there as well.
 Today, I mean, we have a lot of people have to call into our call centers.
 they have to walk to our stores to get
 basic service. And a lot of these
 things can be done if you have
 if you have the right digital platform.
 So my MTN is really the pivot for that, where we're seeking to allow people to do things themselves.
 We want to increase the percent of self-service interactions with our support team.
 and that's a big focus for us this year.
 So there are a number of initiatives around that, looking at things like chatbots, looking at AI that can support customers remotely, looking at IVR solutions as well, which we already have in place.
 but really to expand the usage of these to our customers
 because our customers tend to be a bit shy of adopting some of these solutions
 that we have in place.
 So that's just to list a few of them.
 But there are several other things that we're doing beyond just, you know, support, beyond just sales channels on the product side, simplification of our portfolio, digitizing their interactions, consolidating our shortcodes.
 These are all things we're doing to simplify the journey and the experience for our customers.
 And finally, on the technology side, ensuring that our technology platforms and infrastructure
 that kind of support
 digital ecosystem.
 them. So the network, this is why I haven't
 forging on every site is important to us.
 And two, looking at modernizing our IOP systems so that we can have the right environment from a security standpoint, from an operational standpoint, and from a reliability standpoint to deliver on these digital services.
 So there's quite a lot of bacon there that we're working on.
 We're going to be very busy this year.
 All right.
 Great.
 Thank you.
 on the
 Yeah, on the KPEX side, just to clarify, all KPEX spend capitalized within the year they
 your care.
 none is set aside for any other and beyond that the the core capex um is the h5h that maybe you
 you need reference to.
 You have TikTok, CapEx for 2020.
 when you check it on the IFRS 16,
 was 1.489.
 and under IAS 17 is 1.397.
 So, that is our perfect details.
 So all of them are capitalized,
 were capitalized within the 2020 year.
 And just to add that the difference between the core and the total will be things like licenses, right, Kobe?
 yeah
 licenses and software that are related to network systems
 Sorry, can you clarify on the CapEx question?
 so
 the number that I saw
 was
 it was
 even when you add the licenses and whatnot,
 It was still only just over one.
 Yes over because we have we have spectrums as well as core network assets
 The spectrums were about 360 million.
 So, those are the plus.
 other software and licenses so uh maybe maybe we have to look at what you are looking at and give
 with federal clarity, but that looks good.
 And then just one quick follow-up on that is how much of your CapEx would you consider to be growth CapEx relative to maintenance CapEx?
 Come again, I didn't quite catch what he said.
 How much of your
 would you consider
 maintenance of the existing network
 versus
 maintenance
 Maintenance are treated as OPEX, so maintenance doesn't form part of KPEX.
 I think to clarify, I think the question is, you know, we have maintenance capex, which would be we need to implement that to keep the network going with the existing capacity.
 and then there's
 incremental capacity
 and coverage
 I didn't
 adding capacity to existing networks.
 Yeah.
 Perhaps we can take that offline and look at the breakdown, if I may suggest.
 Yeah.
 That's what I suggested.
 So maybe we'll pick it up.
 Jeremiah, take notes, and then let's get back to him on the details.
 Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the time.
 Thank you.
 Do you have any closing comments?
 Yes, please.
 So I'd like to thank everyone for making time to join us today for this call.
 So, again, I'd like to apologize for the long hold at the start of the call and the extension
 of the time of the call as a result
 of this vote
 I know there are quite a number of questions in the queue, but I'll be glad if you can reach out to me and then I can access you with your answered questions.
 You can also visit the investor page on our website, that's ntn.com.gh, to download our
 financials and accept any other relevant investor information, which includes the transcript
 and audio for this call, which I'll be
 adding up in the coming week
 so
 thank you and you may now
 in the home.
 Thank you.
 Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's conference.
 Thank you for joining us.
 you may now disconnect your lines.

With that said, I'd like to turn the call over to Benedetto. Thank you, Nicoletta. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Three months have passed since the last time we met digitally all together, and many things have happened in our company. Today, I will be delighted to take you through the 2021 result, and I will provide a little taste about what's happening in our company. Our performance in 2021 was very robust, from both a quantitative and qualitative point of view. Numbers first. We closed the years, setting a new record in terms of results across all metrics, posting double-digit growth and above pre-pandemic level. The results were higher than the targets we had already upgraded when we shared our third quarter results. Five excellent results to remember. First, 4.3 billion euro revenues, materially exceeding, for the first time in our history, the threshold level of 4 billion euro. Over 11,000 cars shipped with significant growth in all regions. In China, our deliveries doubled year over year. 35.9% exceptionally strong EBDA margin reached at a record level. Impressive 640 million euro industrial free cash flow generation, mainly thanks to the advances collected on the special series, and thanks to the discipline and timing of CAPEX spend. And all this, we have no impact on our product plan. The last point is, we have the strongest ever order book in our history. Up double-digit versus the prior years, and covering well into 2023, with all regions showing significant growth. How did we achieve these five excellent results? Firstly, we have to thank our incredible customers, both existing and new, and all the women and all the men of Ferrari for their outstanding work. Secondly, it was possible thanks to the strong margin contribution of the Monza SP1 and SP2. Thirdly, this was further boosted by our decision to seize commercial opportunities on certain models in line with our order intake evolution. We also benefited from deliveries of the SF90 Stradale being moved to 21 from previous year 2020. And, last but not least, we have capitalized on a strong economic climate, as evidenced also by the solid performance of our pre-owned business, and on the enthusiasm of our customers, whose delight in sharing their Ferrari passion with us has been so evident at our event. After these five excellent results, the five key priorities we focused on on all the year 2021. Product excellence, customer experience, motor racing, brand diversification, and carbon neutrality. Let's start with product. Last year, we unveiled four new models, demonstrating our leadership in technology, in design, and driving experience. They all received an enthusiastic response from the market and worldwide acclaim. In May, we unveiled the 812 Competizione and the 812 Competizione Aperta, our latest special series with its revolutionary aerodynamics, and they were all sold out prior to the official launch, as a testament to the vigorous demand for our V12 models. Just a month later, in June, we launched the accelerating 296 GTB, featuring our latest hybrid powertrain, combining a V6 turbo and electric motor. It exceeded previous models, order intake, over the same relative period, and now a solid pipeline of experiences for our customers is already planned for the current year, further fueling our ambition for this model. I drove this car several times, and the go-kart feeling and the fun-to-drive experience you can have are really unique, believe me. A few weeks ago, in November, the new Icona, the most powerful V12 ever made, whose unveiling I had the pleasure of attending in Florence, surprised our most loyal Ferraristi. I'm talking about the Ferrari Daytona SP3, a masterpiece of craftsmanship, performance, and design, already awarded internationally and limited to 599 units, which have all been allocated in advance of its premieres, and with untapped demand, way, way exceeding the limited series run. So, we enter this year, 22, with considerable momentum, thanks to two factors. One, the strongest ever order book, and two, a broad portfolio of models. The order book first. It has never been so strong. The positive trend characterized the whole year, and continued in Q4, when we experienced impressive order intake, despite our decision to close the order collection on certain models. Second, the new product portfolio. Not only do we have the broadest, most innovative, and most beautiful range of cars ever offered to our customers, but we also plan to further enrich these with two server launches this year, completing the 15 launches promised at the Capital Market Day in 2018. In these years, in 22, we will unveil the much-anticipated Puro Sangue, which I'm confident will exceed our customer expectations. I drove it several times in the hills around Maranello, the day and night, for the test, and I can testify that the driving experience is really astonishing, but I do not want to say more to avoid to spoil such a surprise. Now, after product, customer experience. In the course of 2021, it has been really liberating to be able to start arranging events with them again. To mention a few of them, we marked Cavalcade's 10th anniversary with a very special event in Sicily for classic and modern drivers, and we restarted our Tributi and Corse clienti activities, culminating in the Finale Mondiale at Mugello, where I met so many of our customers and fans, all passionate about Ferrari. Now, our motor racing activities. 2021 was our best ever season in GT racing, with Ferrari winning the drivers and manufacturers' world titles in FIA World Endurance Championship, and with victory at the 24 hours of Le Mans with our 488 GTE EVO. The Formula One 2021 season also showed encouraging signs toward its end, with third place in the Constructural Championship. 2022 is the first year with a complete new set of technical rules, and our new car will be presented in a few days, on February 17th. We are also redefining our strategic partners along three directions. One, we welcome back Banco Santander. Two, we tap current segments with new partners, such as SIVA Logistics in the transportation space. Three, we strengthen our relationship with leading-edge technological partners, partners such as amazon web services and velas to be at the forefront of digital technologies and web 3.0 such stronger partner portfolio confirms one once again the continued allure of the most successful team in f1 history scuderia ferrari and what about the brand diversification well last year we made excellent progress in extending our brand into exciting new territories in june we launched the first ever ferrari fashion collection in july we reopened the iconic cavallino restaurant in the heart of maranello and in the second half of last year we renovated our stores in italy and usa in 2022 we plan to move forward and the first important milestone will be the upcoming fashion show in milan later this month last but not least carbon neutrality by 2030. in a further step towards our goal in q4 we received iso 14064 certification for our calculation of the group's carbon footprint this certification has been really an important step forward in addition to our electrification journey we are also committed to addressing both direct indirect emission with a focus on energy and material across all our entire entire value chain as always our focus was not only our external stakeholders we continued to invest in our employees true to our founders believe that ferrari is made above all by people we invested in training for our employees caring for their well-being and nurturing the diversity of talent in our company our efforts were rewarded in 2021 by equal salary certification for the second consecutive year in italy and for the first time in the united states the year has been really outstanding thanks to the passion the dedication of ferrari people and to reward their achievement in line with the company's strong performance indicators i'm really pleased to announce the company the yearly competitive award up to slightly over 12 000 euro for our employees and now after the 2021 highlight let's have a look at the future at our future a small taste before providing the full picture on june 16 when we meet here we are targeting 2022 to be a solid year on the trajectory to reach the 2023 abda target of 1.82 billion euro as announced in 2018 how do we want to do this how we want to achieve this goal well there are three clear direction we identified number one we will carefully manage a vibrant order intake in line with our strategy to pursue control and grow to preserve our brand exclusivity two we will manage the monza's face out whilst the daytona's deliveries will start in 2023 three as i already explained in the last call innovation requires partners and it is what we start to do love from amazon and velas just to mention a few of them and some others some other important technology partnership will follow up in the near future 2022 is a very important year for us it's not only the 75th anniversary of our company it also sets the foundation for a new business plan which will be presented at our capital market day on june 16 here in maranello this will also be occasion to meet in person some members of our new organization recently announced and achieved through both the promotion of our home grown talents and the number of key strategic external lives the new organization is designed to further foster innovation optimize processes enhance agility and increase collaboration people are the soul of our company and i'm confident we will seize the opportunities ahead of us in this fast evolving environment i will now end over to antonio who will review the 2021 result and 2022 guidance thank you benedetto and good morning or afternoon to everyone who is joining us today let me start on page seven where you can see the highlights of the 2021 earnings a very strong year which shows high double digit growth on all metrics compared to 2020 and more meaningfully a remarkable increase versus pre-pandemic levels our shipments reached 11 155 units up 22 percent versus the prior year and 10 percent versus 2019 group net revenues were 4 billion and 271 million euro increased 23 percent versus prior year and 13 15 percent versus 2019 driven mainly by volume and stronger product mix abda came in at 1 billion and 531 million euro up 34 percent versus 2020 and close to 21 percent versus 2019 the abda margin reached a record level of 35.9 percent boosted by the contribution from the ferrari monza and an otherwise very rich product mix ebit was 1 billion and 75 million euro up 50 percent versus 2020 and 17 percent versus 2019 the improvement of both operating margins compared to our latest guidance mainly reflects the upward revision of the commercial revenues from the f1 commercial right holder recorded in q4 adjusted net profit was 833 million up 56 percent versus 2020 and 19 percent versus 2019 resulting in an adjusted diluted eps eps of 4.5 euro improved by 56 percent versus prior year industrial free cash flow for the year industrial free cash flow for the year was exceptionally strong at 642 million euro supported mainly by the collection of the advances for the a12 competizione turning to page eight you can see the details of the shipments of the full year 2021 up 22 percent versus 2020 sales of eight cylinder were up about 35 percent while 12 cylinders were down 16 percent mainly due to the reduced volume volume of the a12 superfast which was phase out in the year our deliveries were driven by the range models the f8 family the ferrari roma and the sf90 stradarion which reached global distribution the portofino m and the sf90 spider in rapid phase shipments of the ferrari monza sp1 and sp2 were higher compared to the prior year in line with planning and reaching the end of production all geographic regions posted double digit growth moving to page nine you can see the walk of our group net revenues up 26 percent at constant currency the increasing revenues from cars and spare parts up almost 29 percent at constant currency was supported by higher volumes and strong enrichment of the product mix along with personalizations revenues from personalizations were higher than the prior year in absolute terms sustained by volumes they were in line with the historical average at around 18 percent in proportion to revenues from cars and spare parts engines revenues were up about 26 percent the improvement is related to higher shipments maserati and to a lesser extent to the rental of engines to other formula one racing teams the increasing sponsorship commercial and brand up close to 13 percent at constant currency was attributable to the more favorable formula one calendar and brand related activities partially offset by lower prior year ranking this increase reflects also the upward revisions of the commercial revenues from formula one that i mentioned before currency including translation and transaction impact as well as foreign currency edges at the negative contribution of 80 million euro mostly related to the u.s dollar and the japanese yen this quarter moving to page 10 let me review the change in our ebit bridge explained by the following variances first volume was positive for 220 million euro reflecting the shipments increase second mix price variance was also positive for 212 million euro boosted by a richer product mix thanks to the f90 family and the ferrari monza sp1 and sp2 along with personalizations partially offset by the ramp up of the ferrari roma and the portofino m and the reduced contribution of the a12 superfast as already mentioned by benedetto the product mix in 2021 was further boosted by our decision to seize commercial opportunities on certain models in line with order intake evolution had also benefited from deliveries of the sf90 stradale being moved to 2021 from 2020 third industrial and r&d expenses increased 65 million euro mainly due to higher dna product innovation activities and formula one expenses net of technology related government incentives as well as startup costs fourth sgna were negative by 14 million euro mainly reflecting communication and marketing activities of model unveiling and lifestyle events as well as the comer the company's organizational development lastly other increased 83 million euro reflecting the more favorable formula one calendar and higher contribution from band related and other supporting activities partially upset by the impact of the lower formula one ranking of 2020 the total net impact of currencies was negative for 77 million euro as a result of what i just mentioned ebit reached 1 billion and 75 million euro up 50.2 percent versus the prior year with an ebit margin of 25.2 percent turning to page 11 industrial free cash flow generation for the year was remarkable and equal to 642 million euro sustained by the strong growth in abda and the collection of advances on the a12 competition the working capital dynamic including the the above mentioned advances provisions and other receivables and payable was almost neutral also due to the cadence of our capital expenditure which stood at 737 million euro the capitalization ratio was approximately 39 percent for the year and in line with the prior year net industrial debt as of the end of december 21 was 297 million euro compared to 500 for 43 43 million euro at the end of 2020. it's worth mentioning that excluding the dividend distribution of 162 million euro and 231 million euro of sherry purchase we would have been cash positive at year end let's move on page 12. here we explain the main drivers of our guidance for 2022 which targets a solid growth and continues to demonstrate the ebda progress on the trajectory to reach our 2023 ebda target of 1.8 to 2 billion euro as announced back in 2018 while in 2022 our profitability will continue to expand in absolute terms carefully leveraging our record order book percentage-wise the marginality will be flattened by a product mix which will be richer but not enough to offset the negative impact of the monster phasing out and of the daytona deliveries starting in 2023 more diversified by but lower revenues from sponsorship and a step up in dna in line with the start of production of new models which will start the deliveries in 2023 or which contribute marginally in 2022 on the industrial free cash flow side the generation will be robust supported by the strong operating results and the collection of advances on the daytona sp3 this will be partially offset by capital expenditures of approximately 800 million euro as we expect the lower capex seen in 2021 to rephase partly in 2022 but also by much higher taxes commensurate to the very strong results posted in 2021 page 10 12 we show the progress that we aim to achieve based on our guidance since our starting point of 2018 until the end of 2022 in essence as of the end of this current year we want to be very close to what we promised at the 2018 capital markets day for the accumulated ebda and fully on target in terms of accumulated industrial free cash flow generation over the planned period albeit with a different time profile and we want to achieve such results despite the impact of this pandemic subject to meeting our ambitions i believe this will prove once again the resilience and strength of our business model based on brand exclusivity product excellence leading edge technology and innovation such awareness allow us to look at the future with great confidence with that said i turn the call over to nicoletta thank you thank you antonio nadia please we are now ready to start our kina session thank you dear participants we will now begin our question and answer session as a reminder if you wish to ask a question please press star and one on your telephone keypad and wait for a name to be announced the first question comes through line of michael bennetti from credit suite please go ahead thank you good morning guys thanks for all the details today and for taking our questions um i guess i'm trying to think about the structure of the guidance you laid out for 22 relative to where we were at um i know you guys have been focusing us on the on the 2018 analyst day and helping explain the differences and similarities as you've pushed out the 1.8 to 2.0 billion next year but you're this year you've got revenues in line at 4.8 with the low end of that original plan but ebit um below by maybe 100 million at the low end of the plan maybe you could just help us understand what's different on the same revenue base that that drives ebit um a little bit lower um this year and if it's you know i think you were originally said maybe a few units of prosang would would start to ship in 2022 today you clarified that that they'll be in 23. so maybe it's a timing mismatch but i wonder um how much of it might be attributable to the profitability of prosang relative to the to the overall fleet if that's is that a car that you view as a creative to to corporate margins or to the rest of the fleet antonio can you ask me with thank you michael if i got your question right i think the difference compared to the guidance we gave back in 2018 is largely due to the different timing of introduction of the cars compared to what we modeled at that time obviously we are seizing the commercial opportunity that we are having so the significantly strong order books on on v8 entry models is helping in that respect um while as we mentioned i think the the gap that we have between the phase out of the of the monza and introduction of the daytona is a is impacting the the level of the margins both ebit and ebta in addition to that as far as ebit is concerned we have this dna impact which is due to the fact that we start producing new cars that are coming in in the next one i don't know whether this is enough or i think in terms of color and this should help um let me let me follow that for one second you have that daytona and prosang confirmed to start shipping next year after what you described as a as a headwind from mix this year largely monza but if the guide is now 1.8 to 2 billion for next year the low end of that guide assumes ebitda growth will slow to about six percent in 2023 from 11 percent in 2022 how should we think about the the top end versus the bottom end of the guidance in that range what would what what scenario do you see that would explain a slowdown to the to an ebitda growth next year maybe maybe there's some phasing of investments as you guys look out to big big initiatives like electric and those kind of things i'm just curious if you could help us think about that yeah i think volumes we keep on growing anyway with better margins with mix which will be stronger which is supported by by the new economy coming in um and this isn't the as far as the contribution of our core business and then we added the other businesses that we expect also to grow i mean brand is still very low in 2022 we expect it to be better um in terms of a one there are some elements including the budget cap introduction but that's of course in terms of the cost side okay thanks and congrats on a great year guys appreciate it thank you thank you the next question comes the line of adam jonas from morgan stanley please ask your question uh thanks very much and i cannot wait until june 16th uh that's going to be really that's going to be so special so i look forward to meeting you all in person um benedetto uh when you you you guys recently struck a deal with the swiss blockchain uh company velos network uh how should investors think about the potential for the ferrari brand in the metaverse uh or in the nft or digital space thank you for the question uh jonas and also looking forward to meet you in person the 16th of june i i think that as we said no it's important that we look and we see how the new technologies can help the our brand for sure the the digital technologies the web 3.0 technologies that are using the the blockchain and the nft is an area that is can be interesting for us it deserves some attention there are many as you know there are many there is a lot of movement on the market about this some companies even change the name and i think this is an area that where we have to put our attention and that's reason also why i put the we have in place if you have seen in the organization a department that is called a digital in the rate in data because i mean it's an important dimension that we as ferrari we have we have to evaluate it to consider for the future okay uh look forward to learning more about that uh benedetto um my follow-up is do you believe electric vehicles expands the addressable market for the ferrari brand and if so how so do you think that the electric vehicles will expand the brand do you think that as ferrari brings forth all electric vehicles that that grows the addressable market and revenue potential for the brand and if so how do you see that happening or why okay i think the the the point is the following i mean electrification is one one technology like the digitalization that we will harness always in our unique ferrari way as you know we already started to hybridize our model a few years ago we have already three model on the road that are pretty much successful sf90 stradari spider and 296 gtb and i believe that the electrification is a way is a technology the way that can help our brand to keep the pace with the time that's what i believe uh adam okay thanks thank you the next question comes from land of susiti balti from ubs please ask your question hi thank you for taking my question um so my first one would be um just to go back on michael's question on the 22 guide um so your revenue uh guide for 2022 um is is quite high um and uh so given that the mix is going to be not that strong it kind of implies a good step up in volume um and so i was wondering if this is a correct assumption or if there is something else that will contribute meaningfully to the top line uh because you mentioned that also in terms of some sponsorship is a bit lower so it seems like the this good increase in revenues should come mostly from the from the from the volume growth so i just wanted to check if that's the right way to think about it hi suzy antonio speaking your assumption is correct volume will be higher so we'll grow there and this is because also the order book is significantly higher than we're used to um discovering well into 2023 um it's not true that the mix is weak i mean actually the the product range mix is high it's simply not enough improving compared to the loss of the of the monza and the introduction some few some months later of the daytona okay but basically year over year volumes will be positive and mix we expect to be um slightly negative overall okay okay got it um and on pricing um so in 21 it was the first time that you you pushed through a like for like price increase about two percent um if i remember correctly was mostly due to the inflation to the inflation um and given that inflation for the moment is not really going away um should we expect something similar for 22 like are you planning to uh potentially push through some price increase if um you know to offset the inflation or was it a one off in 21 yeah this is a good an important point i mean there is some pressure on the energy on the aluminum cost and we will and we will apply this price increase to consider for that but we will also leverage other important levers when it comes to the pricing of the new model and selected i mean a price increase of selected model and also the personalization so this is an important factor we are factoring in susie okay very clear and very quick just a follow-up on your free cash flow uh that you so in the slider you should have you basically um you're in line you you achieved the the 2.4 to 2.8 accumulated cash flow as promised so um so basically the fact that um you were guiding previously to a 1.1 to 1.25 billion industrial cash free cash flow um it's just a matter of phasing right because it feels like um that has been just faced differently due to the to the phasing of the models or was there some kind of advances for a future maybe hypercar which has now been changing timing no you you got it right susie uh phasing is the exact answer okay okay perfect thanks a lot welcome thank you the next question comes online of john murphy from bank of america please ask your question uh good afternoon everybody and thanks for the time um just wanted to follow up or not on that pricing discussion i mean obviously there's there's cost inflation that's going on but you're talking about your order book um being longer than it ever has been before so is there a greater opportunity to you know take price explain it to your your customers as there's cost inflation to you um they're relatively sophisticated to offset that but then also to maybe you know help balance out the supply and demand um in the business it's a very high class problem but it seems like there might be a greater pricing opportunity than you've ever even had before thank you i think this is what you say it's important and uh we are considering uh i mean we we we are applying the price increase and we are monitoring carefully what's happening on these two dimensions of energy and aluminum and again as i said we will introduce also new model and the new model we will apply in the right way the pricing so this is an important dimension that we have uh we are we are careful about also because uh we all know what is the pressure that there is in the supply chain all over the world on the other side i have to say that we have also uh on the supply chain uh i mean we have some um good partners reliable partners we can leverage on okay and then just a second question on the transition to evs um you know it's very interesting that daytona is a v12 uh naturally aspirated um engine um you know that sounds great to me personally um but you know obviously there's a push towards towards evs um given your your close relationship with your your customers and and and you kind of build a design engineer and build what they want what are you hearing from your customers at this point on this transition i mean many other companies are you know slaves to guessing at where ev penetration will go and what they should do with their powertrain investment but you have direct access and good discussion and relationships with your customers so what are they telling you because on the daytona it seems like they're saying hey we probably don't want this right now but um the reality is some people might so i mean what are your customers telling you right now but i think we have uh i mean we have different kind of uh ferraristi each one with its own uh preferred the let's say models and the propulsion so we have a ferraristi that i have seen them in florence when we launched the daytona and they were extremely extremely happy and delighted to see such a beautiful car i have seen also customers trying the 296 gtb that is a kind of different uh different car with different feeling so i think that if you want to get my uh feedback from the customer is that we have customers with different uh feeling different needs different perception and uh even the same customer for different moment can have uh can prefer the the v12 the aspirated one or the v6 hybrid so there is a mix of different uh customer with different feeling and different uh need different emotion but it's fair to say that you're not guessing at this you're you're having these discussions with your customers so you're you're you're what you're introducing and you're building is what they want you're you're never going to go here you miss estimate the ev penetration on on your on the models right i mean it's this is something that's well known by by you through that order book and your discussions with your customers is that that a fair statement i'm saying that the there is a clear trend and we will work on for sure an electric vehicle and we will see the strategy line up here in june on 16 what i want to say is that there are customers different customers that prefer different kind of a propulsion scheme so we are aware obviously what's happening we have planned for that but we are also aware of the different feelings and different emotions the customers want to get with different propulsion scheme okay great thank you very much thank you thank you the next question comes online of julio pescatore from bnp paribas exam please ask your question hi thanks for taking my question i just want to follow up on the previous point in your answer did you mean that as long as customers will want combustion engines you will be willing to provide them even if we think about 10 or 20 years down the line i think that the technology is useful as far as it addresses customer needs we have to delight customer we have to i mean this is this is important for us so if we are moving piston or we are moving other other things that's what we want to to do okay thank you and then the second question on the order book for the 296 gtb which you said builds faster than than the previous processor of that vehicle does that mean that that car could potentially do the same type of volumes that i don't attribute f8 or 488 did in the past and can maybe talk about the difference in demographics between that vehicle and uh and the 488 maybe yeah you can go on to the next i think you have one provided the forecast on volume life cycle uh however as i said as benedetto said before it the the receipt has been very strong in terms of order compared to our previous internal benchmarks the other element yes i think you're addressing the fact that the our customer base for this car is likely younger and this is true i mean really you need to drive it to experience it it's uh oh after you to provide a driving experience at your cmd i'll be more than happy yeah we will the car is here fantastic great to you i'll be there um maybe just one last one before i pass on to the next speaker uh on the forecast for 2022 um i really struggled to to bridge your guidance which feels very very conservative uh at the lower end at least i understand the step up in capex i understand um that they're going to be higher taxes but um can really help us help us with uh the amount of deposits that you should expect um from from the daytona and uh how many deposits did you receive last year for the competition because it's really difficult to bridge the numbers oh well um i'm not comment on the degree on conservatives of the estimate but basically and our cash flow is relatively simple i mean we have the abda and you know what the guidance is you know what we said about capex i think the whole question is about the working capital where we include in the wider definition also the impact of the advances on the limited series cars uh so the daytona we are talking about more than 200 million more or less in in terms of current estimate the other element you should not underestimate is the impact of taxes because uh we are obviously paying taxes both in terms of the balance and the advance on the basis of the results of 2021 and it makes a big difference compared to what we paid in 2021 based on the results of 2020 that were impacted by by the pandemic hope this provides you a better understanding of the detail yeah but you're still benefiting from the pattern box right yeah the button box is helping but not in terms of cash no at the level it did at the very beginning because now the law provides for the benefit cash wise in three install three year installment so this has been already visible in 2021 and it will be obviously in 2022 okay thank you welcome thank you the next question comes online of martin diambrogi from equita please ask a question thank you good morning good afternoon everybody my focus is on capex which is a portion of the lower free cash flow for the current year so the 800 million may be considered a sort of peak for capex or should we expect they will go beyond the 1 billion annually going forward and when you talk about partnerships i remember you also mentioned partnership in order to reduce capex i clearly understand you cannot talk about something was not announced but just to elaborate a bit on on this in order to understand what could be the magnitude of the reduction in capex if any thank you thank you marco you remember well the the partnership are an important way forward for us and as i said also before there would be some partnership that some important partnership for us we will announce in the near future i i think that i mean it's important that is always also what i said in my previous life to keep a strong discipline about capex and to keep the momentum and to to make sure to do something innovative uh it's uh it's important we decide what we do internally and we decided and what we want to do with partners outside so the two words are partnership and discipline and as i said in the near future you will hear about an important partnership on something that is important for for our car but for which let's say we believe the the best way forward is is partnership and on the amount of capex 800 million could be considered as a peak you you can consider is more or less a a good number to think about because we will use as i said the the partnership to to optimize and to be disciplined okay thank you and uh talking about volumes uh based on what you commented before i would expect a higher volume growth than the usual let's say average six percent we saw in the last few years yeah this is a better result of the significant net order uh intake increase that we have seen this year so we need to serve this one obviously we'll be very careful because the concept of scarcity remains crucial to our business model and this is an element of significant attention we'll play all all leverages to manage this one and for sure the broadest portfolio the broad portfolio we have it's helping to protect also the brand exclusivity because in this year we have a lot of a lot of models that are in production thank you thank you the next question comes online of stefan reitman from satire general please ask a question yes good afternoon thank you for this um i understand what you're saying about the mix in 2022 so just that we'll dig a little more detail in there first of all um it reminds me that you'll still be selling to monzas in the first quarter of 2022 so um we could see maybe something back there and the second question is about the cadence of deliveries of the a12 company company a um how many would you expect to be delivered in 20 there is a lot of noise on the background we are having problems to understand your question i don't know it seems there is a someone a mute i don't know i'll try again sorry okay try again maybe sorry about that um yeah i'm sorry no um i just want to ask so first of all um understand that you will be selling still some eight sports and monzas in the first quarter of this year this final model will that have an impact expected in the first quarter of this year still and secondly could you talk about the cadence of deliveries of the a12 competizione um obviously a very high margin for you in the course of 2022 thank you even i think in terms of the monza will complete the deliveries of the of the montane in q1 um however then the absolute number will not be uh as high as it has been during the last quarter of this year um the a12 competizione and competition aperta will be spread quite evenly across the four quarters thank you welcome thank you the next question comes to the line of george golias from goldman sachs please ask your question thank you for taking my question yeah the first question i had was um just on the volumes obviously you're now above 11 000 units i think in the past uh previous management mentioned that max capacity was about 15 000 units on the existing industrial footprint is is that still roughly the right number to think about and in order to get there presumably you'd have to add shifts what's the kind of lead time from a training perspective to add incremental shifts the second question i had was with respect to the carbon neutrality by 2030 do you still expect e-fuels to play a prominent role in reaching that target and then finally obviously we had significant management changes and some exciting promotions and external hires during the quarter um perhaps you could give some insight into the skill sets you were looking to promote as part of those management changes thank you thank you i start from the last one the management change and the carbon neutrality in the first one uh antonio will take it so let's start from the management change yes we did a big change at the beginning end of last year beginning of this change the beginning of these years and uh we did along two directions if you have seen on one side we promoted our internal talents that i had the pleasure to see because i talked to a lot of people in the company and also with external liars i think what the common threat that we wanted and i wanted to push within this new organization are the four the four following ones number one the strong willingness to cooperate number two is about uh attention to innovation and number three is the focus to bring these things especially in a transition area to make the right the the the right choice the right decision with the right timing and to move forward and number number four is uh is very important especially nowadays this is becoming very important for all the companies in this continuous learning approach because we have to to be open to listen at the other point of view other people point of view and also the supplier point of view the partner point of view so these are the features that i want to boost with the uh the new organization again organized with the homegrown talents and also external hires this gives for granted let me say competencies that are all these people are bringing in uh in the game coming to the second question the carbon neutrality as we said the carbon neutrality we we will show you a clear plan in when we meet here in maranello the target is to become carbon neutral by 2030 we want to do it looking at all the carbon emission we generate directly as well as the carbon emission that get generated along the value chain and we want to do in a scientific way scientific way and so that's reason why we are also proud if you want of this iso certification we got in q4 because it testifies that we are uh substantiating these numbers with scientific approach i think that if we want to tackle this properly we needed to be to to do it scientifically and that's what we will do and that's what we will show you in in in june now the the first question antonio you can take yeah george uh on the first one yes 15 000 units is the the level of capacity that we have there has been no change in that respect and the second one we are working on to shift and we predict to be there and even for 2022 of this great thank you yeah very helpful thank you very much and looking forward to the cmd likewise thank you the next question comes to line of monica bossio from intense san paulo please ask your question uh good afternoon everyone i hope you can hear me uh my first question is on the volumes growth in 2022 on the back of the strong order book the ramp up of the new entry models in 2022 the volume is volume's impact will be significant over the current year i was wondering if this could bring to some phase out of some models such as the s8 and uh as for the price mix uh uh i was wondering if you can elaborate uh on what do you expect in term of personalization for uh 2022 and uh my second question uh is uh our housekeeping questions uh as for the advances uh from the daytona should we assume uh an impact mostly in the first part of the year is it correct and uh in terms of uh taxes you mentioned that the taxes will be higher at the cash impact level in 2022 can you give us some highlights at the pnl level thank you very much i take the part of the the face out of the model as i said the in in q4 we stopped at the the we did not take an order anymore on some some model and this is done for the sake of brand exclusivity the personalization gives a good contribution to our to our top line and uh for the daytona the taxes maybe antonio can take it sure um the daytona is significantly contributing in terms of cash flow with the advances on q1 maybe you remember what happened back in 2019 with the with the monza um and in terms of taxi yes we are currently projecting something like approximately 200 million additional cash out for taxes during the course of 2022. 200 million thank you very much welcome thank you thank you very much dear participants thank you very much for all your questions and now i would like to hand the conference over to our main speaker

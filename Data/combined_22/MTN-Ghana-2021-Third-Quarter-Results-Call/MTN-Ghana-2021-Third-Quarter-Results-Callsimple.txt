 Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to NTN Ghana's 2021 Q3 Results Conference Call. All attendees will be in listening early mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions when prompted. If you should need assistance during the call, please signal in operator by pressing star and then zero. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now hand the conference over to Mr. Jeremiah Opoku. Please go ahead, sir. Thanks, Judith. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss MTN Ghana's third quarter performance for the period ended 30th September 2021. I'm Jeremiah Opoku, Investor Relations Manager for MTN Ghana. With me on the call today are Saloma Dadivor, CEO of MTN Ghana, Antoinette Kofi, our new CFO, who joined MTN on 1st October. Elihene, CEO of Mobile Money Limited. Kobna Bentiencho, our General Manager of MTN Ghana Finance. And Tato Motlandi from Group Executive for Investor Relations. So Salom will share an overview of our performance for the third quarter and outlook for the rest of the year before we move on to the Q&A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call operator. The call is scheduled for an hour, and if there are any more questions, we may allow a five-minute time, extra time. So I'll now hand over the call to Salom. Thank you. Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making the time to join us on this call today. On the call, we'll discuss our third quarter performance, and I'll also touch briefly on our expectations for the rest of the year before we move on to Q&A. In Q3 2021, we maintain the momentum from our half-year performance, underpinned by our diligent execution on Ambition 2025, investment in network and IT systems, and ensuring our people remain a priority in light of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 26 October 2021, the official Ghana statistics on COVID-19 showed a rise in the total infections and deaths to 103,823, respectively. MTN Ghana continues to extend support to Cherish customers through our Yellow Hope initiatives, including the zero rating of all mobile money P2P transfers up to a value of 100 Ghana cities a day. And we're also running the One More Push campaign to encourage everyone to wear a mask and get vaccinated. We at MTN continue to adhere strictly to all COVID-19 protocols with the aim of safeguarding the health and safety of our people and of our customers. And we also remain committed to Ghanaians and the environment in support of the continuing fight against COVID-19. Turning to our operational performance for the period, we recorded a 25.4-year-on-year growth in service revenue, driven mainly by data and mobile money. We continue to deliver on our infrastructure modernization plan and implemented CAPEX-related infrastructure projects to expand 4G capacity, 4G coverage, and to improve the quality of service for our customers, and to improve the quality of service for our customers. Over the period, we invested a total CAPEX of approximately 1.060 billion Ghana cities, which includes the rollout of 959 4G sites, the modernization of 1,543 existing 4G sites, and this helped expand our 4G population coverage by 4.7 percentage points to 84.7%. We grew our active subscriber base by 0.4 million quarter-on-quarter to 25.2 million, and this reversed the decline in the last quarter that we experienced. This was supported by our network investment, digital offerings, and an improvement in quality of service overall. Looking at the various business segments, we recorded a 51.9% year-on-year growth in data, driven by increases on our active data subscribers and total data consumed within the period. The contribution of data-to-service revenue expanded from 29% to 35.1%. Voice revenue recorded a single-digit growth of 2% year-on-year. The growth in voice continues to be impacted by shifts in customer behavior towards data and implementation of SMP directives. The contribution of voice-to-service revenue declined from 42.5% to 34.6% year-on-year. We expect the trend in the voice segment to continue as a result of continued growth in smartphone penetration and the preference for data services by consumers. However, we expect data growth to compensate for the slower growth in voice. Mobile money revenue increased by 45.3% year-on-year, supported by increased active users, higher P2P transactional activity, and growth in advanced services such as retail, merchant payments, microloans, insurance, and international remittances. The contribution of mobile money-to-service revenue increased from 19.6% to 22.8% year-on-year. We recorded a 23.8% year-on-year decline in digital revenue, which was a result of the continued impact from the application of the principal versus agent accounting standard across the MTN group in 2020. On a normalized basis, digital revenue increased by 14.4% year-on-year, supported by growth in our active digital subscribers. Reported EBITDA increased by 27.5% year-on-year, with a margin expansion of 1.1 percentage point to 54.4%. And this was supported by our continued focus and execution of our expense efficiency program. Profit after tax growth for the period was 34.0% year-on-year, and as announced last quarter, we paid the interim dividend of 0.03 Ghana cities per share, totaling an amount of 369 million Ghana cities. And this payment happened on 14th of September 2021. Looking at the regulatory landscape, the National Communications Authority, the NCA, through the telecom operators, is embarking on a six-month nationwide SIM re-registration exercise using a Ghana National ID card as a sole card for this purpose. This exercise will run from October 1st, 2021, to 31st March, 2022. MTN has begun this exercise and remains committed to support the government to register all existing and new subscribers on our network. As announced in the previous quarter release, MTN Ghana implemented the directive from the NCA on Phase 1 of the On-Net, Off-Net Price Differential Removal on default tariffs for voice, data, and SMS from 1st of August 2021. Phase 2 is scheduled to be implemented on November 1st, 2021, to extend beyond the default tariffs to cover promotional offers and special offers. Including the above remedy, we have implemented all three of the seven SMP remedies defined to date by the regulator. We will update the market and implementation of the remaining four directives as discussions with the NCA progresses. Now turning to our outlook. We expect to maintain the business momentum through the last quarter of the year. We will continue to expand 4G coverage and improve our network to further enhance subscriber growth and customer experience. In addition, we will progress the execution of the expense efficiency program and our prudent approach to managing costs to deliver on our commitment of margin expansion. We will continue to support our employees, our customers, and communities as we deliver against our ambition 2025 focus areas for the year in order to capture long-term growth opportunities and create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers and I look forward to interacting with you over the next one hour. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to press the star and then one on your touch-tone phone to keep out on your screen. If you decide to withdraw your question, you're welcome to press the star and then two to exit the question queue. Just a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to press the star and then one. The first question comes from Jonathan Kennedy Good of JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. First one is on selling distribution and marketing expenses. I just wanted to check whether, you know, it looked like I think there was 24%, 25% growth in that fairly large OPEX line and just trying to understand whether there were any one-offs there or it was due mainly to the pandemic base of last year and trying to get a handle on what we should expect growth to be like in that expense line going forward. And then on the implementation of phase two of the regulation on on-net, off-net pricing, how do you expect that to impact voice revenue? Should we â€“ would it be substantial pressure on the voice line or could growth be maintained? Okay. Thank you for your questions. Let me start off with the first one, which is the distribution and marketing expense line. So this is really an anomaly for this year. This year is our 25th anniversary. And as part of our 25th anniversary, we've had various programs which have shifted our expenditure, I guess, patterns. So, you know, that spike you see or that abnormality you see in Q3s as a result of the 25th anniversary, this should normalize through. So no major concerns there. In terms of phase two of the S&P on-net, off-net, I believe the last time we spoke, I shared our estimate at the time to be about 1% impact on total revenue. The current implementation we're undergoing may increase that number slightly, maybe somewhere around 1.2% to 1.5% in terms of the total S&P impact on that. But until we've implemented it and seen what the trends are, it will be a bit difficult to be very specific. We're here assuming things around how customers will react in terms of elasticity and all of that. But I'm fairly confident we should land somewhere in that range for the S&P on-net or off-net, as far as the expectations are. Great. Thank you. Jonathan, does that conclude your questions? Yes, it does. Thank you. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Prashandran Odaya of NetBank. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations on your results, and thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions. Sorry, I've got four. I hope they're not too long. First one is around the Newsom registration procedures. Would that pose any challenges to meet the March 2022 deadline? And are there any subscribers at risk that you guys know about? And linked to that, what would be the revenue impact if those subscribers had to be disconnected? Secondly, I noticed you reiterated your timeline to have the localization of 25% of the telco and 30% of the mobile money business by the end of the year. Can you just give us an update on your progress to date? I think the last time we spoke, there was the employee share scheme that helped on the localization of the sell-down. I think there was only about 8% to 10% that still needed to be done for the telco. So just an update on that and also what progress you've made on the Momau localization would be much appreciated. The last two is I noticed you're still also zero rating your P2P transfers under 100 Ghana CDs. What is the revenue impact of this? The last time we spoke, which was at Inserum, it was roughly around 6 million Ghana CDs per month. So how has that transpired with the increase in mobile subs? And the last one is how much â€“ I mean, I don't know if you can tell us how much of your 45% increase in Momau revenue would be attributable from integrating Momau into the Ioba, MTN Ioba during the period. I know there was some integration in there that seemed quite positive. So, I mean, is there anything that could be attributable from that integration in your Momau revenue? Thanks very much. Sorry, if you could just repeat that last question. It wasn't too clear. Sure, sure. So I believe you integrated Momau into the MTN Ioba platform during the period. So how much of your 45% increase in Momau revenue could you, if possible, attribute to that integration? Okay, gotcha. All right. So let me start with that one. To be honest, the Ioba is still quite young and we've seen, you know, quite some interesting behaviours. But at this point, I think any revenue attribution will be, you know, will be a little premature. So that amount is quite low. So we can ignore that for purposes of materiality at this point. But the whole essence is to build a behaviour and at some point we'll see a lot more significance around that behaviour. The second question, let me start from the top in terms of SIM registration. The first question was on SIM registration and whether there is risk on the March 2022 deadline. Absolutely, there is risk. This is a major undertaking. And as you can imagine, you know, once this starts, there are a number of key things we have to bear in mind. For status, the National ID database currently has somewhere between 15 to 16 million registered customers. It's unclear to us how many of that, you know, are within each network. But there are plans on the way to expand the scope and the registration points to increase those numbers to close up to 20 million, maybe somewhere between 18 to 20 million will be the expected number by, you know, by the end of March. The second element here is our rate of registration, new registration. There are still some teething issues we're dealing with around how to validate with integrations with the National ID Authority. So we believe all of these will be taken into consideration on the timeline. But at this point, our primary objective is for the base of NIA, which is National ID Card Registered Subscribers, our objective is to maximize the registrations of our customers within that base as quickly as possible. We've declared, we've actually declared a few stations that will be doing registrations in areas where we don't have stores and operational centers because it will take too long for people to travel to us. So these are some of the plans we're putting in place. This will happen nationwide on a calendar starting from November. We're also investing a little bit more in devices so that we can have as many agents put on the ground who can go around registering customers and do the validations real time as well. And so the number of things we're putting in place to be able to do that, we've already developed some technical solutions as well that will facilitate the faster registration. So there's a lot of work that's going on, but there's absolutely risk. It will be a bit difficult to give numbers at this point because the exercise really just started. But so far, there have been some challenges with the integrations, not just for MTN. This is an industry thing. So I'm quite sure once those are resolved, we'll have a better sense of the rate of registration and what the real risk means. But so far, we're definitely ahead in terms of our market share registrations. So we'll continue to put in the focus on that side to minimize the risk on the back end. On the second question, which was on localization and where we are with that. So in terms of scan-con localization, which is up to 25%, I believe the last time we said we're at 17.5%. So that percentage hasn't changed. However, we are at advanced stages in discussions with various elements of the plan to execute that. So I think we are â€“ I mean, there is some risk in getting to the end of the year, just about a 25 mark for Skanko. So we are working to the wire on this one. But today, we have very good commitment, which will suggest that it's a manageable ambition for us to get to that 25% mark. On the 30% to Skanko, I'm sorry, to mobile money, there is a dependency on getting to 25% on the parent company and then achieving an additional 5%. So the focus there is achieving that additional 5% on the assumption that Skanko achieves the 25%. And we do think that that will be quite a challenging feat at this point. We continue to work with various offers on the table and interests, but the timing will be quite challenging. So, again, we're having chats with the central bank on the different options that we have there and we'll update you in that process. But overall, I would say, you know, we've made quite some good progress, even though we haven't crossed any major milestone. We're very close to some milestones in the coming weeks. And we look at this process as quite positive from that perspective. The third question was on, you know, the free P2P and how much revenue that represented in the quarter. So, a total revenue of about $45 million was the fee P2P, if we assume we are charged for those transactions specifically, for the quarter three, only the quarter three. And it's about the same amount. It went from about $35 million to $40 million, quarter one, quarter two, and 45 in quarter three. Thank you very much. Sorry, Jeremiah, just a quick one. In the first half of the year, it was around $34 million Ghana CD's impact for the whole year. So, are you saying in just this one quarter, it was $45 million? Because that's a big jump then. It's more than double. So, in quarter one, it was $34 million. In quarter two, it was about $40 million. That total was about $73 million. Oh, okay. And then in quarter three, it's $45 million. So, I think you have your numbers mixed up. Yeah, no, okay. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. You're welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from Jake Ward of Ashmore Group. Hi, Salaam. Just have a couple of questions on the active Momo subscriber base. It just appears, looking through the quarterly releases, the total active Momo subs has remained a bit unchanged since the back end of 2020, around that 10.5, 10.6 million level. I'm just wondering what you think has caused that slowdown in getting new active subscribers. And perhaps touching on the strategy that you may have in place to address that. And if you could also just remind us how you, at MTN, define an active subscriber here. Okay, thank you very much. So, yes, if you look at the numbers, we've hovered around a 10.5, 10.6 mark for multiple quarters. Just to emphasize that we came out of Q1, we saw a declining trend in Q2, which was quite concerning in terms of Momo subs. So, we saw a 1.9% decline quarter two over quarter one. In terms of quarter three, we've seen a reversal of that trend with about a 1% growth in mobile subs over Q2. Of course, that means we still have some deficit to get to the Q1 levels. But the positive news is that the reversal is happening, and we have to continue to build off of that foundation. The reasons for the decline in the first place were a number of different things. But the most impactful one was, you know, a pilot to implement IDs on cash-out, right? So, people requiring IDs to cash out cash from us. This was done, you know, in partnership with the central bank, or at least in alignment with the central bank. And there were considerations for cash-outs to become a requirement, IDs on cash-out to become a requirement for the entire industry. That determination has not as yet been done, and we've had discussions with the central bank on the steps forward, and no conclusions have arrived at this point. But there is a positive to all of this. We've also seen some impact of all of this in our efforts in trying to minimize and mitigate and fight fraud. And so, there is that element, which was the initial objective of all of this, was how do we â€“ okay. So, the second component, which was, you know, a benefit from this activity, was the reduction in fraud, or at least the management of fraud. We've seen quite some good improvements as a result of this initiative, plus other initiatives we've put in place. But going forward, Q4, we have a full plan on how to accelerate and be more aggressive on subscriber acquisition, and we're executing on that plan. So, I'm positive that we'll get through the rest of the year with some positive trends in terms of new MoMA subscribers and growth in the total subs for MoMA. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on that. On my last question, are you able to disclose the number of MoMA subscribers who aren't active? Is that very different from the number you report? I can't recall your definition of active. Is it one transaction per month? Yeah. So, active is a revenue-generating activity in 30 days, at least one revenue-generating activity in 30 days. Okay. That makes sense. And just one final one, if I may, then. If people are taking advantage of the free P2P at this time, am I correct in saying that they therefore wouldn't show up because it's not a revenue-generating transaction? Oh, no. The fact that you're not charging doesn't make it a non-revenue-generating activity. A P2P is a revenue-generating activity. So, they will show up. Yes. Okay. Very clear. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Kuda Kudungura of Kela Securities. Afternoon, guys. Thank you for hosting the call. Just have a few questions. On mobile money, what was your revenue mix over the third quarter for MoMA? Well, and then the â€“ if you could just maybe give us an insight into the volatility around your MoMA commissions. I mean, you know, there was quite a substantial growth over the first quarter, second quarter, understandably, as a result of zero rating, and then suddenly a notable pullback over the third quarter. And then on the data side of things, how many active 4G subscribers are currently on your network, and then how much data was consumed over the nine months. Okay. Thank you very much. Let me start off with the mobile commissions, because that's quite an intricate one. I think that we'll probably spend a few minutes on. And I'll come back to active 4G customers and data consumption. I'll check if I have those numbers here. And then the revenue mix as well. So in terms of the commissions, you know, we've been looking at our commissions trend, you know, for a while now, and I think there have been questions here on investor calls on the dilution of EBITDA margin. You know, this came up last quarter as well. What we've discovered is that there were some transactions that were manipulated by a set of agents and merchants that are on our network. And through the extensive exercise our revenue assurance team and the more money team have done, we've been able to put a lid onto those activities. What that has meant is a portion of our commissions, which would have been paid out, you know, in previous months and will no longer be paid out. And the effect of that started in July. So you'd see an improvement in commissions despite continued revenue growth. And that results in margin expansion for the quarter. Okay. So we've been looking at our commissions trend in the last quarter, and we've identified some discrepancies in agent and merchant behavior that was resulting in a significant increase in our commissions overall. And through the work that the revenue assurance team and our own money team have done, we've put a lid on this behavior and managed to arrest the situation with a number of initiatives that we've put in place. What this has meant, though, is that our commissions, a portion of our commissions that we had paid out in previous months is no longer being paid out because we've noticed that the trend and the, I guess, the undeserved earnings of commission through this scheme. And as a result of that, we've seen lower commissions in quarter three and higher EBITDA margin and higher EBITDA numbers for that same period. And we're confident we can maintain this trend going forward and that this trend reflects, better reflects the commission revenue ratio of the business. So we should see, you know, a lot more steady EBITDA and commission rates going forward as a percent of revenue. So that's why you see the changes in commission trend as well as EBITDA trends for Q3. That's the main reason. So I'll pause here and see if there are any specific, any other questions on that, otherwise I'll go to revenue mix and the other questions that you had. No, I think that answers much of it. Quite amazing that they impact transactions that much. I mean, those are some significant increases there. But yeah, please proceed. Yes, no, absolutely. It's, you know, quite significant. Okay. The second question was on the revenue mix of mobile money. And I'm guessing it's the split of, you know, you know, what proportion is P2P versus cashout versus others? Correct. Yeah. Advances. Yeah. Advances. Okay. Cashout and P2P. Okay. So in general, we've seen quite a, quite a good growth in advanced services during the period. Percent of total revenue from advanced services is around the 19, 20% mark. And we're seeing a continued growth in P2P as well in terms of, in terms of the percent of total revenue, around the 45% mark, and then the balance, sorry, around the 35% mark, and then the balance will be from cashout. So it's roughly 35% P2P, about 20% advanced services, and about 45% cashouts. That's some, uh, significant growth in P2P there. Yeah, we continue to see good, if you look at the P2P activity in terms of their P2P, their customer, we're seeing quite healthy growth in those numbers, and then the activity continues to be good. Okay. Uh, okay, great. That, that, that answers that next question. Um, and I guess to the, to the data, uh, related questions. I'll have to come back on a data question. Let me just pick up the details. Apologies for that. I guess what's the way to, well, I've, I've, I've got another question. I, I noticed that, uh, you don't include extra time as, as, uh, part of MoMo revenue, and, and nor do you also include non-core MoMo services. Now, what are non-core MoMo services, and how much was extra time, uh, over the, over the nine months? Okay, so we don't, we don't include extra time, because it's not, um, from the definition by our regulator, the central bank, um, extra, extra time is not classified under mobile money. And, you know, therefore, including it means we'll be reporting businesses that are not governed by that particular regulator in the reports that we send to them. So that's the main, that's the main reason we don't do that. Now, in terms of what is, what is non-core, there are a number of partnerships we have. For example, micro-insurance partnerships with IO Holdings, that is non-core, MoMo revenue. So you can think of extra time in IO revenue as non-core, and the totality of that will be our FinTech portfolio. All right, thanks for that. Akira, does that conclude your questions? Um, sorry, uh, on, on the 4G, active 4G subscribers, did you have that, uh, number, or is, or I'll have to follow up. Sorry, I'm, I'm trying to pull it up. Once I get it, I'll let you know. Okay, all right, appreciate it. That's all, then. Thank you. The next question comes from Andrews Odoa Agbaloli of UPSA. Thank you very much. Um, I want to ask a question regarding the share performance on the Ghana Stock Exchange. This year has been remarkably leading the market. I know you don't tell yourself to be watching the share price while they are on the deck. But perhaps you could be doing something that, you know, uh, in the few words, you can't tell it what is moving that, whether that rally can continue into the future. But, you know, within six months or so, uh, we've seen some recruits from the highs of, you know, where it went, that is 1.24 and then to 1.2. So, uh-huh, I know, like what I said, you can give us some tips of, you know, like shareholders. We are interested in the appreciation just as you paid as a discipline. So, if you can give us some hope or what to expect, thank you very much on that. Thank you. Okay. Well, thanks for your question. Um, let me just sort of start off with, um, you know, what we control and don't control and, and the path that we play. And I think the first thing as management is, is that our role is to deliver on the business performance and to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders and our investors. And, however, we do know and understand that there are other exogenous factors that drive share price and share movements on the stock exchange, which are out of our control. So, the only commitment I can give is that, you know, we'll continue to deliver on the targets we've set. Um, we already have committed to, to a modest, um, over, our performance of our media targets that we've given you. And, you know, we give you our reassurance that we will continue to perform at that level as far as running the business operationally goes. Um, so from that perspective, I think you can be, you can be confident in management's ability to deliver on these numbers, um, and, and manage the associated risks and challenges that the market presents to us. Thank you very much. Going on to the next question, which comes from Nana Bonana of Axis Pension. Hi. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question and congrats on another good performance. So, I just want to know management outlook about MoMo in the light of a potential launch of central bank digital currency, i.e. the ECD. I mean, do you see the ECD complementing and deepening MoMo acceptance or perhaps competing with MoMo. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for the question. And, you know, very, very good question. Something we are very interested in watching as well. You know, at this point, I won't be able to give you too much, too much detail on our position, but I think, you know, first of all, the objectives of the ECD and what the central bank is trying to do, um, are definitely laudable. We see ourselves as a partner and as a, you know, as a partner to continuing to digitize currency within the country. And we do believe that we have a role to play. However, since this is a pilot from the central bank, the definition of how ECD will manifest itself beyond the pilots is still unclear. And the role that the existing digital services will play is also still unclear, but we continue to work very closely with the central bank. And at a point when, you know, some of these definitions start to tease out, we'll be able to share. And our view, though, is that, you know, more money has established, you know, a behavior within the marketplace. And there's a lot of equity we can bring to a partnership to make ECD successful. So we see ourselves as a credible partner to the central bank and to further digitize the market using ECD. But we'll give you more details once it's clear. The last question, I mean, it's got to do with the structural separation of the MoMo, I mean, business. I mean, do you see the potential expansion in the timeline given by the BOG? Or do you think, I mean, you can do it within, I mean, the January 2022 deadline? Parading, please. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. Look, I think I was mentioning earlier that we definitely are to the wire here. And we do have, you know, very concrete commitments and, you know, over 25% of the total localization targets. But there's still a gap we have to bridge to get to the 30%. And we're working very hard on that. And so, yes, is there some risk? Absolutely. I think, you know, in terms of timing, there's some risk. But in terms of achieving the objective, we're confident we will. So it might just be an issue of a little bit extra time to close everything off. But we're confident we'll get to 25% in the coming months. And then also confident that we'll have the full commitment to get to 30%. Perhaps the execution of that extra bit, we need a little bit more time to tidy up. So that's where we are. And that's, you know, what we're working towards. Thanks. Thank you. That should be it for me. Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Smith of 337 Frontier Capital. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the results. Fantastic order. Can you ask a question on market dynamics and market share? What, do you guys know what your market share in Momo is currently? Can you disclose that? Can you also talk about maybe competitive pricing in the market to Momo? Are you guys losing any market share to vote of cash given, I mean, your zero-rated P2P of this across all pricing brackets? And have you given any consideration to changing your pricing structure? Okay, sorry, the line wasn't too clear. I think you're asking what the competitive dynamics on more money is considering P2P price tactics. Is that correct? Yes, yes. I know my line is not very good, but, yeah, that's the question. Okay. So there are a couple of things going on. You know, we do have one operator that has launched free P2P or launched free P2P quite aggressively last year and sustained that for, you know, for quite a long time. In the last few months, we've seen some intensity continuing to promote the free P2P across, you know, all networks, but also across all value bands, which is a very aggressive promotion. So absolutely, yes, you know, we initially, I think on the call last time around, we discussed a little bit what some of the effects of that will be at the beginning. We think we've gotten to a point of equilibrium to a large extent because there are other things that we're also doing to try to support our customers and try to create value for our customers on our network. And we're also continuing to expand our own ecosystem and advanced services. You would see the growth in advanced services today represents the utility that customers see in the portfolio of services worth in our mobile money. And we believe some of these initiatives will continue to be important in giving the customers value, but also serving the needs that are most important to them. From a landscape perspective, we, you know, we'll continue to monitor this. And at a point where we feel that there's a need for us to do something slightly different, and we'll certainly do that. But you see some of our promotions have been coming up to the end of the year that are promoting international remittances. Some of these things are all things to create increased value for our customers. So we want to play the game in a more strategic way, and not just on the basis of price, because that really starts to change the dynamics of competition. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Admire Mvolwani of Tira Partners Asset Management. Thanks for the call. My question is on the SIM re-registration using the Ghana ID. From your experience, possibly maybe in Nigeria and other countries, how many sort of subscribers do you expect to lose who don't have the proper documentation to be able to re-registrer? And what will be the impact on the top line? Okay. Look, it's a very difficult question to answer concretely because of the stage we're at in the process. We're right at the beginning of the SIM registration process, and we've already experienced a few teething challenges with the process itself. These are being ironed out. There's been some progress, but there are still a few things to complete. So all operators are affected by the feeding challenges that are in place. In terms of what's realistic until the end of March, a lot of that is based on how aggressive operators are, but also how responsive customers are to the demands for them to re-register. We're seeing quite some good numbers reaching out to us. We've had over 2-point-something million customers already reach out to us to re-register, and I've gone through the process. We've had maybe 10%, 15% failure rates on the re-registration from that base. So there's activity happening, and this is even at a time when there are still some challenges. I guess to answer your question, I guess it's a bit premature to suggest and to come up with numbers that may not register. If we look at Nigeria, for example, they had multiple extensions to SIM registration as a result of the number of people within the populace who had the national ID. It's a slightly different situation in Ghana here, where today you have over 50% of the 30-something million already with a national ID, and the effort to continue to register the balance is ongoing. The national ID authority is expanding branches in all the regions so that that activity can take place. So we're in a slightly different place from what happened in Nigeria. I don't think we can directly compare the two situations. The Nigeria base that was registered as a percent of the population when SIM registration started was extremely low compared to the 50% we have in Ghana today. So different dynamics, but nonetheless, I do acknowledge the risk of losing subscribers at the end of the period. And I can assure you that we will do everything and throw everything at this to make sure we minimize the gap between the registered base and the non-registered base to the extent that we can. And we're taking this process very seriously, and we've already come up with plans on how to get closer to customers so they don't have to â€“ the effort for customers to re-register is lower, because we're reaching out to them and setting up these temporary registration desks that will be moving around the country. So there are a lot of things we're trying to put in place to make this as successful as it can be. Thank you. Thank you so much. My second question is that I may be wrong, but I think last year you were still able to grow voice revenues in double digits, and you suddenly dropped to over 2%. Is that pointing â€“ what would have happened, and does this point to a position where voice revenues will start to decline? Right. So, you know, last year we grew voice in single digits, and I mean, we obviously had quarters where we had double digits, first two quarters of the year, and then we saw a change in trend from Q3 to Q4 in single digits. But nonetheless, we've seen pressure on voice, and there are a number of drivers on the voice trend. I mean, the first one is we're seeing a lot more people shift to behavior from being voice-centric towards data-centric services. So that's a natural evolution when people get smartphones and start to do more data services. But the second element is some of the initiatives that have been implemented as a result of the significant market power declaration. The first one, the asymmetric at the end of last year, and then August 1st, the SMP on-and-off-net parity application that went live on August 1st. All of these have had some pressure on voice, but I think the fundamental driver in terms of significance is really the consumer change and the acceleration of smartphone penetration within the network. Currently, we're sitting somewhere between 45% and 50%, and we've seen this trend reflected in other markets where the penetration gets to these levels, where the voice utility starts to go down very fast in favor of data. Okay. So given that trend, what sort of EBITDA margins are you focusing? Because traditionally, data and mobile money are lower margin business lines compared to voice. You know, data is slightly lower than voice in terms of margin, if you have to separate the effects out, but we really don't separate it out. Mobile money is actually a high margin product. So we continue to commit to expanded EBITDA margins. I believe we committed to that at the beginning of the year, and that commitment is still in place, and we believe we'll deliver on that for the end of the year. Okay, thank you. I think I'll join the queue if I have more questions. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Farouk Maya of AllAfrica Partners. Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the call. I have three questions. First question is just focused on the dynamics between your MoMo subscriber numbers, the data subscribers, and voice. And so we've seen the penetration, the percentage of voice subscribers who also happen to have data and MoMo's, you know, increase over the last few years, but now starting to stall somewhat. So I just wanted to check, I mean, from your side, is that something that you're tracking? Is that a key KPI, the penetration of data compared to voice? And at the moment it's 47%, for example, data over voice. Is that a kind of very strong limit? And then the focus will turn to squeezing more money out of the existing subscriber base rather than continuing to grow it. That's question one. I'll let you answer it before those two questions. Okay. It's probably worth us taking your numbers offline because we don't have those numbers that you just quoted. I'm not too sure where you're getting those numbers from. But, yes, we do look at subscriber penetration across different products. Yes, that's something we look at and look at how we balance our portfolio. But it's not something we have disclosed. So I'm not too sure how you're arriving at that conclusion. But I think it's fair to say that the subscribers that continue to use voice, a portion of them are starting to use more data. And that's the trend we're seeing. And they are still, you know, if you look at our voice contribution or voice share of total revenue, it's still in the 30% range, which is still very significant. So voice is not, you know, any less significant than it was before. But obviously the year-on-year growth on voice is where we're seeing the declines or at least the slowdown. So just to clarify, my numbers, all I meant was if you have 11.9 million data subscribers and you have 25 million voice subscribers, so it's just one over the other, that was what I meant. And then just to link to that in terms of the consumer journey, do you normally find that the voice subscriber firstly becomes a data subscriber and then a mobile money subscriber, or it could be in any direction? Someone could have no data but still be doing more and more in some way. Yeah, it could really be in any direction. You know, to do data, you need a smartphone for the most part. We do have, you know, data users who do GPRS, but to a lesser extent. But to do data in our active numbers using more than 5 megabytes per second, you're, you know, 99% certain to have a smartphone. But you don't need that to be a mobile money customer. The second thing to note here is our data, our definition of data, active data subscribers, that 11.9 that you quoted, is based on a 30-day active usage and is the same for mobile money. But for our total subscriber base, it's based on a 90-day activity. So we're comparing slightly different bases when it comes to the 11.9 and 25.2. The second question is, obviously, the number of subscribers for data and mobile money has been relatively slow compared to your previous higher growth, but the revenues are still very strong, which obviously points towards very higher, kind of higher usage from the existing users. How long can continue to play out, i.e., the existing users are being squeezed for basically more service versus a need to continue growing the subscriber base for data and mobile money, without which you'll see, you know, data and mobile money revenues starting to slow down? How much more, you know, room do you have just to squeeze the existing users? Okay. Let me put it this way. I mean, if I look at our growth levels for mobile money, today, you know, I'll use, you know, the numbers of our total subs. We have about 10.6 million customers. So there's still, you know, significant room to grow customers in terms of new customers that come on board, right? To almost doubling that amount in the coming years. But a second dimension is the transactional behavior of these customers, and that's what you're talking about in terms of existing customers. Today, I mean, we're doing, you know, something like 6.7 average P2Ps per user per month. And if you take total transactions, it's somewhere in the early teens per user per month. And therefore, from a transactional behavior standpoint, that same number is, you know, upwards of 30 when you look at other markets like Kenya. So existing users have a lot of room to grow in terms of transactional activity. But that wouldn't happen until there is a lot more ecosystem maturity. We've connected a lot more merchants. We have about 200,000. We need to get that number to over a million, 2 million. We need to connect more services in totality. So there are a number of ecosystem opportunities that would allow the existing usage frequency to continue to increase significantly beyond where it is today. So I don't think we're anywhere close to capping that opportunity. But that doesn't take away the recognition that we need to accelerate our active user growth. And that's something we recognize. And this is where we have the plans in place and coming out of Q3 into Q4 to find some permanence to drive in acquisition growth on the Malomany side. Okay, that's very clear. And just last question on CapEx. I saw in the third quarter, I think there's a bit of a pickup in CapEx versus the first half. Could you maybe re-highlight guidance for the year and the medium-term guidance in terms of where you are in the CapEx cycle? So thank you very much. Okay, so typically we deploy a significant portion of our CapEx by the end of Q3. And this year has been a little bit more unique where we have about 20% of our deployment still happening in Q4. Our total CapEx for the year would be somewhere around $210 million. And we are, in terms of commitment, we are pretty much there, 99 point something percent commitment on that value. So we're currently just implementing the balance of CapEx and we should see the rest of the expansions happen through the last quarter, through this quarter. I think that the final date of implementation is around third week to fourth week in November. Any guidance for the coming year on CapEx or coming few years? Yes, I think our CapEx, absolute CapEx number would be just about the same, maybe about 5% higher to 6% higher. But it's in that same range of $210 million, I believe, will be somewhere in the $220 million to $230 million range. Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Ali Al-Nassar of Urgent Asset Management. Hi, Salom. It's Sam, Ali's colleague. I'm calling through Ali's line. I have a couple of questions. The first one is, can you just help me understand the calculation behind average transaction per user per month on Momo? So I think in previous calls you said it was between 5 and 7, but, you know, if we just take the total transaction number and divide it by the active user base, it's a very different number. So can you give us some clarity on that calculation? Sure. On previous calls, the 5 to 7 has been specifically average P2P per user per month. So that number is about 6.7 today. So we continue to see growth, but it's about 6.7. Everything else would be the total number of transactions on a unique user basis per user per month. So it would be difficult to use the total subs to do that calculation, I'm afraid. You would have to have specific scripts to tease out unique customers and unique transactions to do the division. That's why I'm not probably re-content to the numbers we have. Okay. So internally, it's that P2P number that you guys are most focused on? That's correct, yeah. That's the one I've been quoting. So the 5 to 7 is on the P2P. Average P2P per user per month. Okay. Understood. And then my other question as well, sorry, it's again kind of a number question. We see a pretty big difference between the TPV of Momo, the market share that you guys have on a TPV basis, and the market share that's implied by total active users across all mobile money wallets in Ghana. And we're getting that ladder of information from the communications authority data. I think they say there's about 18 million active mobile money wallets, whereas the market share you guys have on a TPV basis is kind of mid-90%-ish. So do you have any idea why there's that massive discrepancy? Because obviously it implies there are lots of kind of active wallets out there that aren't really being used much. Do you have any insight? Yeah, no, I think the â€“ well, I believe that the metric you've seen from the communications authority is registered wallets, not active wallets. So just double-check that because historically when, you know, when a wallet is registered, it goes into a database and represent those numbers to the regulator. But it doesn't mean there's any activity. There are also legacy registered wallets that were never used and are still in the system. So it's a cumulative number. There's been no cleanup of that. So that number doesn't actually represent the degree of activity, which is why you're seeing these discrepancies. The second thing is also â€“ and some of the numbers are quoted on a 90-day basis versus a 30-day activity. But I think this is really more the registered users versus the active users. Okay, interesting, because they say that there's 44 million registered users and 18 million active. So I was just trying to tease out whether, you know, that can â€“ alongside the zero rating of one of your competitors, you know, whether you're kind of seeing anything there, anything on the ground that doesn't sound like you are. Let me just then invite Eli to comment on that. He may have more insight on that specifically. Thank you, Selom. The first thing is, like Selom said, the data on the Bank of Ghana side or at the industry level is handled on a 90-day basis, whereas we report on a 30-day basis. So there's that difference in data. The second one is it may be the latest data, but I don't have that. The third one is, indeed, the activity on our side is higher because of the portfolio of services that we do have on our platform for customers in terms of activity. So that also represents a higher activity on this side versus what you find on the platforms for the other providers. So those three specific reasons could also feed into what feedback you have. But we'll try and get the latest data and also provide that as part of our next update. Thank you. Yeah, amazing. That would be great. And then if I could just squeeze in one really quick one as well, please, Selom. Can you just remind us what you guys are doing in terms of lending products? Are you getting much traction there? Anything you can kind of talk about that? Sure. I'll have Eli share thoughts on the lending products as well. Eli, please go. Okay. Thank you, Selom. In terms of the lending products. Yes, we have seen good traction. But what we've also done is we've tried to improve on the scoring capability so that we can also manage the level of people who default in the loan repayment and improve upon the level of recoveries that we have on that side. But otherwise, we've seen three partners already. Today we work with, let's say, Go or AFB. We work with Echobank. And we work with APSA in terms of the partners who support the loan portfolio. I don't know if that addresses your question. Anything you could say about the size of that product? Or is that still kind of confidential? The size? Today I don't have the specifics on the daily loan that we give out. But that number keeps improving. We can once again provide that on the next call. Thank you. Okay. Great. That's all from me. Thanks, guys. Thank you. The final question comes from Brad Vibitsky of Equinox Partners. Hi. There's two quick questions for me. First is, what's driving the growth in your other expenses line? And then the second question is, I'm curious whether your market share is different between P2P mobile money transactions and, I guess, P2C or B2C or the value-added services. Yeah, let me address the second question, and I'll have Kobe answer the question on the expenses on the other line, the growth in the other line, other expenses line. So today we don't have market information on P2, you know, to be able to give market share by product, you know, as you've described it. So it's very difficult to know what the market share by P2P, B2C, P2B is at the moment. So what we'll have is typically what the transacted value share is, which gives a strong indication of what's being transacted on the platform, an indication of the share across the product. So that's maybe a proxy for P2P activity, but it's absolutely not certain. Kobe, do you want to take the question on the expenses line? Okay, I think we've lost Kobe. Maybe we can take that question offline. If you can just reach out to me after the call. I'll be grateful. Thank you, Jeremy. All right. Thank you, guys. Apologies. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was a final question. I'll now hand over back for closing comments. Okay. Thank you, everyone. And apologies for the eight minutes extension. But thank you for making time for today's call. I know they are unanswered questions, so just please reach out to me after the call, and I'll be glad to assist. Thank you, and you may now disconnect from the call. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you. Thank you.

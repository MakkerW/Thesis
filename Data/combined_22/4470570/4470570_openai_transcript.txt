I now leave you with our Chief Executive Officer, Ricardo Ramos. Thank you, Dina, and good morning, and thank you for joining the call today. Our earnings during the third quarter of 2021 were significantly higher than earnings reported during the same period last year. These results were driven by considerably higher sales volumes and prices across almost all our business lines. We continue seeing very positive market conditions in all the markets in which we participate. The money in lithium market is exceeding our previous expectations. The iodine market has recovered from the pandemic faster than anticipated, while we are also seeing a positive trend in the fertilizer markets. We're now expecting that the lithium market demand should grow close to 50% this year, driven by a strong sales of electric vehicles in all relevant markets, especially in China and Europe. The capacity expansions we have been working on are allowing us to grow even more than the market, leading us to reach close to 100,000 metric tons in sales volumes this year. By the middle of next year, our expansion to 180,000 metric tons should be ready, allowing us to keep on growing our sales volumes. This accelerating lithium market growth is pressuring prices. At the same time, the contracts we've signed last year are expiring. This allows us to expect an average sales price higher than $12,000 per metric ton during the fourth quarter and probably even higher during the first quarter next year. In the meanwhile, the iodine market demand has already reached the pre-pandemic level. This quick recovery has had a positive impact on prices as supply has not been able to respond. We are now expecting total sales in 2021 around 12,500 metric tons with average sales prices increasing from prices seen over the past few quarters. As we are working on expanding our iodine capacity, we expect to ramp up additional 1,000 metric tons in the beginning of 2023, followed by approximately 2,500 metric tons in 2024, all part of our early announced growth plan. We have seen some very interesting developments in the fertilizer markets globally. Supply has been impacted by export restrictions and logistics interruptions. The spot prices for both potash and potassium nitrate fertilizer have reached levels not seen in more than a decade. We now expect our potassium and potassium nitrate average prices to reach almost $700 and over $1,000 per metric ton respectably using the fourth quarter this year. Considering all the positive factors, we now anticipate a record performance during the fourth quarter this year with a significantly higher EBITDA. We remain confident in our ability to deliver future growth while continuing to operate in a sustainable way, creating value for our customers, communities, and all our stockholders. We now open the line for questions. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then 2. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ricardo. I'm going to ask a few questions one by one. When we look into your production for next year for lithium, you've got to 120 already, LCE, you'll get to 180 some point next year. What do you think will be your ability for production next year? And what do you think of your level of sales? Presumably, you want to build some inventory, but what could be your maximum production or maximum sales next year? Thanks. Okay. Hi, Joel. Ricardo Ramos speaking now. About production, at the total production, considering that we are ramped up to 180 during next year, we think it's reasonable to expect a production in the 140,000 metric tons next year. Maybe it's going to be definitely higher than that, but 140 is my best estimate today of the total lithium and lithium hydroxide total production in Chile. About sales volumes, Pablo, what's your opinion? Yeah. Hello, Joel. Well, our idea is to continue growing according to the demand. If we consider that we expect a growth for the next year of the demand between 20% or 30%, we expect to grow our sales in that same percentage. Okay. Now, I appreciate your pricing guidance. Now, when I look at October Chilean customs data, your pricing in October seems well less than 12,000. You're going to average above 12,000, you say, for the quarter. So, I want to know, you know, if you expect to play so much more volume next year, and presumably you're now pricing volume now for next year, like you're pricing volume, pricing ahead for next year, how much, you know, how much of your pricing, how much of your volume in 2022 are you locking in now? Or we expect to lock in by Christmas, let's say. And would you expect that pricing that any pricing you're locking in now for 22, is that all above 12,000? Okay. Well, Joel, this is a noisy question regarding prices, but what we need to remember is that depending on what you negotiate with your customers, it means shorter contracts, longer contracts, depending on the quality of the product, if it goes to battery applications, industrial applications, then you have different prices. What I can say today is that because of the huge demand of lithium and lack of supply, the spot price is today high. But it doesn't mean that we will see these kind of prices for the average price, because, again, it's depending on the conditions that we negotiate with each customer. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. There are two questions, actually. The first one on the iodine business. If you could share a bit of the impacts of the fire that took place in one of our plants and what was the impact in terms of costs during this quarter. And the second question on the fertilizer business. If you could share a bit in terms of the pricing that we are seeing on the market.
and what was being put in terms of cost during this quarter. And the second question on the fertilizer business, if you could share a bit in terms of the pricing that we are seeing on the marketplace and what would you expect going forward for the next year as well. Thank you. Hello, Guillermo, Ricardo Ramos speaking. First about the fire we had in our facilities in the north three months ago, I think. The impact in production was not more than 40 tons because most of the production was recovered in the next month. Finally, about the cost, yes, we had some additional costs probably in the range of $200,000. That arrangement means the improvement of the facility, replacement of equipment. So I'm adding the $200,000, $250,000 total cost involved in the fire. That's why it was not so relevant and we are taking all the measures that this kind of situation will not happen again. It's very important, it's a significant issue for us having a fire in the facility. That's why we are reviewing in detail the situation and now we're better prepared for this kind of situation. About the fertilizers, it's difficult to give you an outlook after the fourth quarter. We know now that fourth quarter is very unusual. Price levels, we are observing price levels that have not been recorded in previous years. As I mentioned to you, we are reaching $700 per ton in the potash, close to $1,000 in the potash and nitrate. I do not have a long-term view. It's important today, it's important to consider that in the potash industry, we are relatively small. Current prices that we have today reflect, I think, a temporary supply and demand situation. One good news, in my opinion, is that the demand of the potash industry remains very strong. That is associated with the better prices of agricultural products. On the other hand, these logistical difficulties of shipments push the prices up. It is very difficult for us to project prices for next year. Definitely, prices for fourth quarter are going to be very strong. The situation is very difficult to predict in the long term. Anyway, it's important to consider that the case of potassium nitrate is different from the case of potassium chloride. All the specialty fertilizers are less volatile. However, although with less volatility, they follow in some way the chain of potash prices. Thank you, Marc. Our next question comes from Corinne Blanchard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Hey, good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been answered, but there's just a few follow-up questions. The first one on potassium. You raised 2021 volume guidance to close to 900 kilotons, which implies a significant catch-up in 4Q. If you could just comment on that catch-up for 4Q. Also, how should we be thinking in terms of volume for 2022? Given the market condition, do you still expect volume to decrease? Would you expect maybe volume to stay close to 800 or 900 for next year? This is Ricardo Ramos speaking. Of course, due to the fact that the prices are extremely good, it's a very unique price environment today, we are doing our best in order to increase the volumes during fourth quarter. We're using some inventories and so on in order to increase the volume during fourth quarter. That's why probably if you put the numbers together, fourth quarter total volume is close to 300,000 metric tons. It's a very strong number we expect to deliver during one quarter. Definitely lower probably depending the shipment. Sometimes you have a delay of one or two shipments from fourth quarter to first quarter. You don't know yet because it will be decided at the end of the month depending the conditions of the port. But anyway, it's going to be a really strong quarter because the price condition will try to push everything forward. About next year, I don't have now a forecast of volumes for potash. Remember that we have a total production in the Salar de la Cama and we use some of the potash, most of the potash in the production of potassium nitrate either for fertilizer or solar source business. That's why depending what's going to be our strategy, especially fertilizer and solar source next year and the total production from the Salar de la Cama at the end, you have at the end the remaining is going to be the potash we will sell to the market. Anyway, as you may know, we are reducing, it's our commitment from the company to reduce the pumping of solutions of the Salar. The most important reduction will be in 2022 as compared to 2021, 23, 24, 25, we will have a small reductions every year, but the most important one is going to be next year. Probably total production of potash at the Salar de la Cama will be between 100,000 and 150,000 tons lower. It means from a total level close to 1.25 million tons, we will move to 1.1 million tons probably production for next year. If you move forward probably reductions because the reduction in pumping will be in the range of 40,000 metric tons per year. But the first year is an important one, it's the 150. The 100 and 150, we don't know yet exactly. We're improving a lot the deals at the Salar level, that's why we expect it's going to be closer to 200,000 reduction. Most of it, of course, will be reflected in the potash industry because our first priority is to supply the potash for our nitrates and potassium nitrate and solar source business. Thank you. And just to come back maybe a little bit on lithium pricing, what's your expectations still going forward and maybe 22, but maybe even beyond that time in terms of considering maybe using a little bit of contract like short-term, a little bit of long-term and maybe switching to some sales on spot. Do you consider maybe switching at some point to a more hybrid model for pricing like some of your peers are doing that or do you rather stick more to contract and off-take agreements for most of the volume? Okay. Well, regarding to the expectation of prices for the next year, we see a strong demand as we already said. However, you know that the price is an answer of the supply and demand, so everything also will depend on the reaction of the supply. We know that there are other projects under development, so everything at the end will depend on how the supply can react to the demand. Anyhow, we are really positive on the demand side, but we need to see what happens within the next year, but we should expect a positive trend. Regarding to the strategy of contracts and mixtures, and it's something that we have said before, we are open to consider different alternatives with our customers. Our idea always is to give to our customers the solutions that they need. In the past, we have announced some long-term agreements. We are under discussions of different contracts with our customers, but at the end, what we are looking for always is to have good contracts for both sides. So, we are open finally to have a mixed strategy between short and long-term contracts. Okay, thank you. Let's move on. And just the last one, do you have any update on construction or any update for the Mount Orland project in Australia? Yes, well, as you know, at the beginning of the year, we announced the final investment decision, so from there, we are doing a good progress. We have started the early construction stage in both sides, that means the refinery in Quinana and the Mojona side, where will be the mine and the concentrator plant. And so far, so good according to the plan. So, everything is going well. All right, thank you. Our last question today will come from Cesar Perez-Neboa with BTG Pactual. Please go ahead. Yes, good morning or good afternoon to everyone. Some of my questions have already been answered. Perhaps I have a weak connectivity here. But my questions would be, what supply conditions does SQM see in the lithium market in general for next year, considering that new volume will come on stream for several producers, including yourself? Second, I am fully aware management provides no pricing outlook. However, most lithium benchmarks are hoovering around two times SQM's indicated fourth quarter price. The question being, in terms of direction, where would your realized price be or if that should come closer to that already embedded in the spot market, considering that, if I heard correctly, 80% of your contracts are yet to be closed, possibly in the first quarter of next year? Any qualitative assessment there would be greatly appreciated. Hello? Okay, Cesar, Pablo speaking. Regarding to your question about conditions in lithium market, as I said before, we are really positive about that. As I told you, we see growth for the next year between 20% and 30%, and that is mainly explained for the electric vehicles penetration. As I said before, the sales of electric vehicles for the year, we expect that there will be between 6.3 and 6.6 million. For the next year, we see that that number will be close to 9 million, so we see that the amount of electric vehicles will continue growing. So we are really positive about the market. We don't have any doubt about that. We see a strong fundamentals of the lithium demand. Regarding to the new supply, well, I think that it's good to see that new projects are coming in the sense that in order to be able to supply this amount, this huge amount of demand, it's good for the industry. So we expect that the important players will continue with the expansion plan that they also have announced, like us. So that's what we see. And finally, regarding to the prices, well, it's really, again, it's really difficult to do any forecast about that because you see that the market is moving so fast, it changes so fast, that

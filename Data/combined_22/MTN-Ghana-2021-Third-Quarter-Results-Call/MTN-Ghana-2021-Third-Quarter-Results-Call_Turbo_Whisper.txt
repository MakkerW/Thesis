 Good day, ladies.
 essentially have some
 and welcome to NTN Ghana's 2021 Q3 results conference call.
 All attendees will be in listen-only mode.
 There will be an opportunity to ask questions when prompted.
 If you should need assistance during the call, please tickle an operator pressing star and then zero.
 Please note that this event is being recorded.
 I am now to hand the conference over to Mr. Jeremiah Opoku.
 Please cover it, sir.
 Thanks, Judith, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss
 MTN Ghana's third quarter performance
 for the period ended 30th September 2021.
 to one. I'm Jerry
 Maupoku Investor Relations Manager
 for MTN Ghana.
 With me on the call today are Salama Dadivor, CEO of MTN Ghana, Antoinette Kofi, our new
 CFO who joined us
 who joined MTN
 on 1st October.
 Elie Henne, I'm CEO of Mobile Money Limited.
 Kovna Ben-Tiencho, General Manager of MTN Ghana Finance
 and Tato Motilande from Group Executive for Investor Relations.
 So, Selam will share an overview of our performance for the third quarter and outlook for the rest of the year before we move on to the Q&A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call operator.
 The call is scheduled for an hour, and if there are any more questions, we may allow a five-minute extra time.
 I'll now hand over the call to Salam.
 Thank you.
 Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone,
 and thank you for making the time to join us on this call today.
 on the call we'll discuss our third quarter performance
 and I'll also touch briefly on our expectations for the rest of the year
 before we move on to Q&A.
 In Q3 2021, we maintain the momentum from our half-year performance
 underpinned by our diligent execution on Ambition 2025,
 investment in network and IT systems
 and ensuring our people remain a priority in light of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 As of 26th October 2021, the official Ghana statistics on COVID-19 showed a rise in the total infections and deaths to 103,823, respectively.
 MTN Ghana continues to extend support to cherish customers through our Yellow Hope initiatives, including the zero rating of all mobile money, P2P transfers up to a value of 100 Ghana cities a day.
 And we're also running the one more push campaign to encourage everyone to wear a mask and get vaccinated.
 We at MTN continue to adhere strictly to all COVID-19 protocols
 With the aim of saving God in the health and safety of our people and of our customers.
 and we also remain committed to Ghanaians and the environment
 in support of a
 continuing fight against COVID-19.
 Turn into operational performance for the period.
 We recorded a 25.4-year-old-year growth in service revenue, driven mainly by data and mobile money.
 We continue to deliver on our infrastructure modernization plan
 and implemented CAPEX-related infrastructure projects
 to expand 4G capacity, 4G coverage, and to improve the quality of service for our customers.
 Over the period, we invested a total capex of approximately 1.060 billion Ghana cities,
 which includes the rollout of 959 4G sites,
 the modernization of 1,543 existing 4G sites,
 And this helped expand our 4G population coverage by 4.7 percentage points to 84.7%.
 We grew our past, we grew our active subscriber base by 0.4 million quarter and quarter to
 $25.2 million, and this reverts the decline in the last quarter that we experienced.
 This was supported by our network investment, digital offerings, and an improvement in quality of service overall.
 Looking at the various business segments, we recorded a 51.9% year-on-year growth in
 data, driven by increases
 on our active data subscribers
 and total data consumed
 within a period.
 The contribution of data-to-service revenue expanded from 29% to 35.1%.
 Voice revenue recorded a single-digit growth of 2% year-on-year.
 The growth in voice continues to be impacted by shifts in customer behavior towards data and implementation of S&P directives.
 The contribution of voice-to-service revenue declined from 42.5% to 34.6% year-on-year.
 We expect the trend in the voice segment to continue as a result of continued growth in smartphone penetration
 and the preference for data services by consumers.
 However, we expect data growth to compensate for the slower growth in voice.
 Mobile money revenue increased by 45.3% year-on-year, supported by increased active users.
 higher P2P transactional activity, and growth in advanced services such as retail,
 So, merchant payments, microloans, insurance, and international remittances.
 the contribution of
 model money to save his revenue increased from
 19.6% to
 22.8% year and year.
 We recorded a 23.8% year-on-year decline in digital revenue,
 which was a result of the continued impact from the application of the principal versus agent accounting standard
 across the MTN group in 2020.
 On a normalized basis, digital revenue increased by 14.4% year and year, supported by growth
 in our active digital subscribers.
 reported over that increase by 27.5% year-on-year,
 with a margin expansion of 1.1 percentage point
 to 54.4%.
 and this was supported by our continued focus and execution of our expense efficiency program.
 Profit after tax growth for the period was 34.0% year-on-year.
 And as announced last quarter, we paid the interim dividend of 0.03 Ghana cities per share.
 and totaling an amount of 369 million
 and ganasides.
 and this payment happened on 14th of September, 2021.
 Looking at the regulatory landscape of the National Communications Authority, the NCA,
 through the telecom operators
 is embarking
 on a six
 month nationwide SIM re-registration
 exercise using a Ghana National ID card as a soul card for this purpose.
 This exercise will run from October 1st, 2021 to 31st of March, 2022.
 MTN has begun this exercise
 and remains committed to support the government
 to register all existing and new subscribers on our network.
 As announced in the previous quarter release, MTN Ghana implemented the directive from the NCA on Phase 1 of the on-net, off-net price differential removal.
 on default tarix for voice, data, and SMS
 from 1st of August 2021.
 Phase two is scheduled to be implemented on November 1st, 2021, to extend beyond the default tariffs to cover promotional offers and special offers.
 Including the above remedy, we have implemented all three of the seven
 SNP remedies defined to date
 by the regulator.
 We will update the market and implementation of the remaining four directives
 as discussions with the NCA progressives.
 Now turn into our outlook.
 We expect to maintain the business momentum through the last quarter of the year.
 will continue to expand 4G coverage and improve our network
 to further enhance subscriber growth and customer experience.
 In addition, we will progress the execution of the Expense Efficiency Program
 and our prudent approach to managing costs to deliver on our commitment of margin expansion.
 We'll continue to support our employees, our customers, and communities
 as we deliver against our ambition 2025 focus areas for the year
 in order to capture long-term growth opportunities
 and create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.
 I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers,
 and I look forward to interacting with you
 for the next one hour.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you very much, sir.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is Tommy.
 If you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to rest the style and then one on a touchstone phone.
 to keep it on your screen.
 If you decide to withdraw your question, you're welcome to press start and 2 to exit the question queue.
 just a reminder
 If you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome
 to Bristol, and there's one.
 The first question comes from Jonathan Kennedy Good of JPMorgan.
 Good afternoon.
 Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 First one is on
 Selling distribution and marketing expenses.
 I just wanted to check whether, you know, it looked like I think there was 24%, 25% fairly large OPEX line.
 I'm just trying to understand whether there were any once-offs there
 or it was due mainly to the pandemic base of last year
 and trying to get a handle on what we should expect growth to be like in that expense line going forward.
 And then on the implementation of phase two of the regulation on on-net, off-net pricing,
 How do you expect that to impact voice revenue?
 should we
 Would it be substantial pressure on the voice line, or could growth be maintained?
 tanked.
 Okay, thank you for your questions.
 Let me start off with the first one, which is the distribution and markets and expense line.
 and so this is really
 an anomaly for this year. This year is our
 25th anniversary
 and as part of our 25th anniversary
 we've had various programs
 which have shifted our
 expenditure, I guess,
 potents
 so
 you know
 that spike you see
 or that abnormality you see in Q3s as a result of the 25th anniversary.
 This should normalize through, so no major concerns there.
 In terms of phase two of the SMP on-net, off-net, I believe the last time we spoke, I shared
 our estimate at the time
 to be about 1%
 impact on total revenue.
 The current implementation we're undergoing may increase that number slightly,
 maybe somewhere around 1.2% to 1.5%.
 In terms of the total S&P impact on that,
 But until we've implemented it and seen what the trends are, it will be a bit difficult to be very specific.
 We're here assuming things around how customers will react in terms of elasticity and all of that.
 But I'm fairly confident we should land somewhere in that range for the S&P on and off net.
 as far as the expectations are.
 Great, thank you.
 Jonathan, is there concluding questions?
 Yes, it does. Thank you.
 Thank you very much.
 The next question comes from Prashandran Odaya of NetBank.
 Hi.
 Good afternoon, everyone.
 on your results, and thanks for the opportunity
 you ask some questions.
 sorry I've got four
 I hope they're not too long.
 first one
 is around the
 use some registration procedures.
 Would that pose any challenges
 to meet the March 2022 deadline, and are there any subscribers at risk that you guys know
 about.
 and link to that, what would be the revenue impact
 if those subscribers had to be disconnected.
 Secondly, I noticed you reiterated your timeline to have the localization of 25% of the telco
 and 30% of the mobile money business by the end of the year.
 Can you just give us an update on your progress to date?
 I think the last time we spoke
 there was
 the
 employees
 share scheme that helped on the localization of the sell-down.
 I think there was only about 8% to 10% that still needed to be done for the telco.
 So just an update on that and also what progress you've made on the Momao localization would be much appreciated.
 the last two
 is, I notice you're still
 also zero rating your P2P transfers
 as under 100 Ghana cities.
 What is the revenue impact of this?
 The last time we spoke, which was at Inserim, it was roughly around 6 million Ghana CDs per month.
 So how has that transpired with the increase in mobile subs?
 And the last one is how much, I mean, I don't know if you can tell us how much of your 45%
 increase in MoMo revenue
 would be a
 So the attributable from integrating Momo into the IOBA,
 and Ayoba during the period.
 I know there was some integration in there that seemed quite positive.
 So, I mean, is there anything that could be attributable from that integration in your Momo revenue?
 Thank you very much.
 Sorry, if you could just repeat that last question.
 and it wasn't too clear.
 Sure, sure.
 So, I believe you integrated Momo into the MTN Ioba platform during the period.
 so how much of your
 45% increase in Momo revenue
 could you, if possible, attribute to that integration?
 Okay, gotcha.
 All right.
 So let me start with that one.
 and to be honest
 the...
 is still quite young
 and we've seen quite some interesting behaviors.
 but at this point
 I think any
 Revenue attribution will be a little premature, so that amount is quite low, so we can ignore
 for purposes of materiality at this point.
 So the whole essence is to build a behavior and at some point we'll see a lot more significance
 around that behavior.
 The second question, let me start from the top in terms of SIM registration.
 The first question was on SIM registration
 and whether there's risk on the March 2022 deadline.
 And absolutely, there is risk.
 This is a major undertaking, and as you can imagine, once this starts, there are a number of key things we have to bear in mind.
 For status, the National IED database currently has somewhere between 15 to 16 million registered customers.
 It's unclear to us how many of that are within each network,
 But there are plans underway to expand the scope and the registration points to increase those numbers to close up to 20 million, maybe somewhere between 18 to 20 million, will be the expected number by the end of March.
 The second element here is our rate of registration, new registration.
 There are still some teething issues we're dealing with around how to validate with integrations with the National ID Authority.
 and so we believe all of these
 will be taken into consideration on the timeline.
 But at this point, our primary objective is for the base of NIA, which is National ID Card Registered Subscribers.
 Our objective is to maximize the registrations of our customers within that base as quickly as possible.
 We've declared
 We've actually declared a few stations that will be doing registrations in areas where
 We don't have stores and operational centers because it will take too long for people to travel to us.
 So these are some of the plans we're putting in place.
 will happen nationwide on a calendar
 starting from November.
 We're also investing a little bit more in devices so that we can have as many agents
 foot on the ground who can go around
 registering customers and doing the validations real-time as well and so the
 number of things we're putting in place to be able to do that. We've already developed
 some technical solutions as well that will facilitate the faster registration.
 So there's a lot of work that's going on, but there's absolutely risk.
 it would be a bit difficult to give numbers
 at this point
 because the exercise
 really just started
 But so far, there have been some challenges with the integrations,
 It's not just for MTN.
 and this is an industry thing.
 So, I'm quite sure once those are resolved, we'll have a better sense of the rate of registration and what the real risk means.
 but so far we're definitely ahead
 in terms of our market share registrations.
 so
 we'll continue to put in the focus on that side
 to minimize the risk on the back end.
 On the second question, which was on localization and where we are with that.
 so
 in terms of
 Cancun localization, which is up to
 25%.
 I believe the last time we said we're at 17.5%.
 So that percentage hasn't changed.
 However, we are at advanced stages in discussions with various elements of the plan to execute that.
 so I think we are
 I mean, there is some risk in getting to the end of the year, just about a 25 mark for skanko.
 so we are working
 into the wire on this one, but today
 we have very good commitment
 which will suggest that it's a manageable, you know, ambition for us to get to that 25% mark.
 On the 30% to Skankom, I'm sorry, to mobile money, there is a dependency on getting to 25% on the parent company and then achieving an additional 5%.
 And so the focus there is achieving that additional 5% on the assumption that Scamcom achieves the 25%.
 And we do think that that will be quite a challenging feat at this point.
 We continue to work with various offers on the table and interests.
 And for the timing will be quite challenging.
 So, again, we're having chats with the central bank on the different options that we have there and would update you in that process.
 but overall I would say
 We've made quite some good progress, even though we haven't crossed any major milestone.
 We're very close to some milestones in the coming weeks.
 And we look at this process as quite positive from that perspective.
 the third question was on
 the free P2P
 and how much revenue that represented in the quarter.
 So a total revenue of about $45 million was the P2P,
 If we assume we are charged for those transactions specifically for the quarter 3, only the quarter
 to three. And it's about the same amount
 So it went from about $35 million to $40 million, quarter one, quarter two, and 45, and quarter
 3. Thank you very much.
 So, Jeremiah, just a
 quick one what the in the first half of the year it was around 34 million Ghana
 I see these impact for the whole year.
 So are you saying in just this one quarter, it was $45 million?
 because that's a big chunk and it's more than double.
 So in quarter one, it was 34 million.
 in quarter two is about $40 million.
 and that total was about 73 million.
 Oh, okay.
 And then in order three, it's 45 million.
 So I think you have been a nice mix then.
 Yeah, okay, cool.
 Thank you very much.
 Appreciate it.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Jake Ward of Ashmore Group.
 Hi, Salaam. Just have a couple of questions on the ActiveMOMO subscriber base.
 it just appears
 looking through the quarterly releases
 The total active Momo subs has remained a bit unchanged since the back end of 2020,
 around that 10.5, 10.6 million level.
 I'm just wondering what you think has caused that slowdown in getting new active subscribers and perhaps touching on the strategy that you may have in place to address that.
 And if you could also just remind us how you at MTN define an active subscriber here.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 So, yes, if you look at the numbers, we've hovered around a 10.5, 10.6 mark for multiple quarters.
 just to emphasize that when we came out of Q1
 we saw a declining trend in Q2
 which was quite
 concerning in terms of
 So we saw a 1.9% decline, quarter two or quarter one.
 In terms of quarter three, we've seen a reversal of that trend with about a 1% growth in mobile
 subs over Q2.
 Of course, that means we still have some deficit to get to the Q1 levels.
 But the positive news is that the reversal is happening
 and we have to continue to build off of that foundation.
 The reasons for the decline in the fairs, please, were a number of different things.
 but the most
 The most impactful one was, you know, a pilot to implement IDs on cash out, right?
 So people requiring IDs to cash out cash from us.
 This was done in partnership with the central bank, or at least in alignment with the central bank,
 and there were considerations for cash outs to become a requirement.
 IDs on cash out to become a requirement
 for the entire industry.
 That determination has not as yet been done,
 And we've had discussions with the central bank on the steps forward, and no conclusions have arrived at this point.
 But there is a positive to all of this.
 we've also seen some impact
 of all of this in our efforts
 in trying to minimize and mitigate and fight fraud.
 And so there is that element, which was the initial objective of all of this,
 How do we...
 Okay.
 so the second component
 which was
 you know
 a benefit from this activity was the reduction in fraud,
 or at least the management of fraud.
 we've seen quite some good improvement as a result of this initiative plus other initiatives
 we've put in place
 But going forward, Q4, we have a full plan on how to accelerate and be more aggressive and subscribe our position, and we're executing on that plan.
 and so I'm positive that it will get through the rest of the year
 with some positive trends in terms of new Maloney subscribers
 and growth in a total successful moment.
 Thank you.
 Just a quick follow-up on that, on my last question.
 Are you able to disclose the number of MoMo subscribers who aren't active?
 Is that very different from the number you report?
 I can't recall your definition of active.
 Is it one transaction per month?
 Yeah, so ACTIV is a revenue-generating activity in 30 days,
 at least one revenue-generating activity in 30 days.
 Okay, that makes sense.
 and just one final one if I may
 If people are taking advantage of the free P2P at this time, am I correct in saying that they therefore wouldn't show up because it's not a revenue-generating transaction?
 Oh, no.
 the fact that you're not charging doesn't make
 a non-revenue-generating activity.
 A P2P is a revenue-generating activity, so they will show up, yes.
 Okay, very clear. Thank you much.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Kuda Kudungura of Killer Securities.
 Afternoon, guys. Thank you for hosting the call. I just have a few questions. On mobile
 money, what
 so it was your revenue mix over the
 third quarter for Momo
 and then the
 if you could just maybe
 give us some insight
 into the
 Volatility around your MoMo commissions.
 I mean
 And, you know, there was quite a substantial growth over the first quarter,
 second quarter, understandably, as a result of zero rating, and then suddenly a notable
 pullback
 We're the third quarter
 And then on the data side of things, how many active 4G subscribers are currently on your network?
 and then how much data was
 consumed over
 of the nine months.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 Let me start off with the mobile commissions, because that's quite an intricate one.
 I think that we'll probably spend a few minutes on, and I'll come back to Active4G Customers
 and data consumption.
 I'll check if I have those numbers here
 and then the revenue mix as well.
 So in terms of the commissions, we've been looking at our commissions trend for a while now,
 I think there have been questions here on investor calls on the dilution of EBITDA margin.
 And, you know, this came up last quarter as well.
 And what we've discovered is that there were some transactions that were manipulated by a set of agents and merchants that are on our network.
 And through the extensive exercise our revenue assurance team and the more money team have done,
 We've been able to put a lid onto those activities
 What that has meant is a portion of our commissions, which would have been paid out, you know, in previous months,
 and will no longer be paid out.
 And the effect of that started in July.
 So you'd see an improvement in emissions despite continued revenue growth,
 And that results in margin expansion for the quarter.
 Okay, so we've been looking at our commission's trend in the last quarter,
 and we've identified some discrepancies in agent and merchant behavior
 that was resulting in a significant increase
 in our commissions overall.
 Through the work that the Revenue Assurance team and our All Money team have done, we've put a lid on this behavior and managed to arrest the situation with a number of initiatives that we've put in place.
 What this has meant, though, is that our commissions, a portion of our commissions that we had paid out in previous months,
 and it's no longer being paid out
 because we've noticed the trend and the undeserved earnings of commission through this scheme.
 and as a result of that
 we've seen
 lower commissions in quarter three
 and higher EBITDA margin
 and higher EBITDA numbers for that same period.
 and we're confident we can maintain this trend going forward
 and that this trend better reflects the commission revenue ratio of the business.
 So we should see a lot more steady EBITDA and commission rates going forward as a percent of revenue.
 And so that's why you see the changes in commission trends as well as able to trends for Q3.
 That's the main reason.
 So I'll pause you and see there any specific, any other questions on that, otherwise I'll
 with Revenue Mix and
 the other questions that you had.
 No, I think that answers much of it.
 quite amazing that
 the impact
 the transaction that much
 I mean, those are some significant increases there.
 But yes, please proceed.
 Yes, absolutely. It's quite significant.
 Okay.
 The second question was on the revenue mix of mobile money.
 And I'm guessing it's the split of, you know, what proportion is P2P versus cash-out versus others?
 Correct, yeah.
 Advances, yeah.
 the advances in cash
 and PTP
 it's okay
 So in general, we've seen quite a good growth in advanced services during the period.
 percent of total revenue from
 advanced services is around the 19-20% mark
 And we're seeing a continued growth in P2P as well in terms of the percent of total revenue around the 45 percent mark.
 And then the balance, sorry, around the 35% mark.
 and then the balance will be from cash out.
 so it's
 you're in the
 Roughly 35% P2P, about 20% advanced services, and about 45% cash outs.
 That's some significant growth in PGV here.
 we consider to see good, if you look at the
 P2P activity
 in terms of their
 P2P
 the customer, we're seeing quite healthy growth in those numbers and in the activity
 continues to be good.
 Okay, great.
 That answers the next question.
 and I guess to the data-related questions.
 I'll have to come back on a data question
 Let me just pick up the details.
 I apologize for that.
 I guess what's the way to, well, I've got another question.
 I noticed that you don't include extra time as part of Momo Revenue,
 and nor do you also include non-core
 one more
 services.
 Now, what are
 non-comoomer services, and how much was extra time over the nine months?
 We need time.
 OK.
 So we don't include extra time because it's not, from the definition by our regulator,
 the central bank
 Extra time is not classified under mobile money.
 And, you know, therefore, including it means we're reporting businesses that are not governed by that particular regulator in the reports that we send to them.
 so that's the main
 That's the main reason we don't do that.
 Now, in terms of what is non-core, there are a number of partnerships we have.
 For example, micro-insurance partnerships with I.O. Holdings, that is non-core, more money revenue.
 so you can think of extra time
 and are your revenue as non-core?
 And the totality of that will be our FinTech portfolio.
 Thanks for that.
 And Kirito, does that conclude your questions?
 Sorry, active 4G subscribers, did you have that number or I'll have to follow up.
 Sorry, I'm trying to pull it up. Once I get it, I'll let you know.
 Okay.
 All right.
 appreciate it
 That's all then.
 thank you
 The next question comes from Andrews Doha Agbaloli of UPSA.
 Thank you very much.
 I want to ask a question regarding the share performance on the Ghana Stock Exchange.
 This year, it's been remarkably leading the market.
 I know you don't tell your staff to be watching the share price
 while they are on the deck.
 But perhaps you could be doing something that, you know, in a few words, you can't know what is moving that.
 whether that rally can continue for the future.
 But, you know, within six months or so, we've seen some retreats from the highs of, you know, where it went, that is 1.24 and then to 1.2.
 I know like what I said, we can give us some keys of, you know, like shareholders.
 we are interested in the appreciation
 just as we paid as a dividend.
 So if you can give us some hope for what to expect.
 Thank you very much.
 I'm done.
 Okay. Well, thanks for your question.
 Let me just sort of start off with, you know, what we control and don't control and the
 part that we play.
 I think the first thing as management is that our role is to deliver on the business performance
 and to deliver on our commitments to you, our shareholders and our investors.
 However, we do know and understand that there are other exogenous factors that drive shared
 price and share movements on the
 stock exchange which are out of our control
 So the only commitment I can give is that, you know, we'll continue to deliver on the targets we've set.
 We already have committed to a modest outperformance of our media targets that we've given you.
 And, you know, we give you our reassurance that we will continue to perform at that level as far as running the business operationally goes.
 so from that perspective
 I think you can be confident in management's ability to deliver on these numbers
 and manage the associated risks and challenges that the market presents to us.
 Thank you very much.
 Going on to the next question, which comes from Nana Bonana of Axis Pension.
 Hi, thank you very much for the
 opportunity to ask a question and congrats on another good performance so I just want to know
 management outlook about Momo in the light of a potential launch of central bank digital
 currency i.e. the ECD
 I mean, do you see the ECD complementing and deepening mumbo acceptance or perhaps
 competing with
 Thank you.
 yeah thanks
 for the question and you know very
 very good question
 something we are
 very interested in watching as well.
 you know at this point
 I won't be able to give you too much
 too much detail
 on our position, but I think first of all
 the objectives of the
 ACD and what the Central
 Bank is trying to do
 are definitely laudable.
 We see ourselves as a partner and as a partner to continuing to digitize currency within the country.
 and we do believe that we have a role to play.
 pilot from the central bank, the definition of how ECD will manifest itself beyond the
 pilot is still unclear, and the role that the existing digital services will play is
 also still unclear, but we continue to work
 very close to the central bank.
 And at a point when, you know, some of these definitions start to tease out, we'll be able to share.
 And our view, though, is that, you know,
 More money has established, you know, behavior within the marketplace.
 please.
 And there's a lot of equity we can bring to a partnership to make EECD successful.
 So we see ourselves as a credible partner to the central bank to further digitize the market using the ECD.
 but we'll give you more details once it's clear.
 I'm not at it.
 That's good.
 So thank you.
 maybe the last question
 I mean, it's got to do with the structural separation of the MoMo, I mean, business.
 I mean, do you see the potential expansion in the timeline given by the BOG?
 or you think I mean you can do it within
 I'm in the January 2022 deadline.
 a rating please
 Thank you.
 yeah thanks for the question
 look
 I think I was mentioned earlier that
 we definitely
 are to the wire here
 and we do have
 in a very concrete commitment
 and you know
 over 25%
 of the total localisation targets.
 But there's still a gap we have to bridge to get to the 30%.
 And we're working very hard on that.
 And so, yes, is there some risk? Absolutely.
 I think, you know, in terms of timing, there's some risk.
 But in terms of achieving the objective, we're confident we will.
 So it might just be an issue of a little bit extra time to close everything off.
 But we're confident we'll get to 25% in the coming months.
 And then also confident that we'll have the full commitment to get to 30%.
 perhaps the execution of that extra bit
 we need a little bit more time to tidy up
 so that's where we are
 and that's
 you know, what we're working towards.
 Thanks.
 Thank you.
 That should be it for me.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Darren Smith of 337 Frontier Capital.
 Hi, good afternoon. Good morning. Thanks for the results. Fantastic quarter. Can you ask a question on market dynamics and market share? What, do you guys know what your market share in Moho is currently being disclosed at?
 I mean, we're zero-weighted P2P across all pricing brackets, and have you given any
 use of it?
 to changing your
 your price instruction.
 Okay.
 Sorry, the line wasn't too clear.
 I think you're asking what the competitive dynamics on more money is considering P2P price tactics.
 Is that correct?
 Yes.
 Yes, yes, or I know my line is not very good, but yeah, that's the question.
 so there are a couple of things
 a couple of things going on
 You know, we do have one operator that has launched free P2P or launched free P2P quite aggressively last year and sustained that for, you know, for quite a long time.
 In the last few months, we've seen some intensity
 continuing to promote the free P2P
 across, you know, all networks, but also across all value bands,
 which is a very aggressive promotion.
 So absolutely, yes.
 we initially
 I think on the call
 last time around. We discussed
 a little bit
 what some of the effects of that will be at the beginning.
 and we think we've gotten to a point of equilibrium to a large extent,
 because the other things that we're also doing to try to support our customers
 and trying to create value for our customers on our network.
 And we're also continuing to expand our own ecosystem and advanced services.
 you would see the growth in advanced services today
 and represents the
 represents their
 utility that customers see
 in the portfolio of services worth in our mobile money.
 and we believe
 some of these initiatives will continue
 to be important
 in giving customers value
 but also serving the needs that are most important to them.
 From a landscape perspective, we, you know, will continue to monitor this.
 and at a point where we feel that there's a need for us to do something slightly different
 and we'll certainly do that
 But you see some of our promotions have been coming up to the end of the year that are promoting international remittances.
 Some of these things are all things to create increased value for our customers.
 so wonderfully they gave in a more strategic way
 and not just on the basis of price
 because that really starts to change the dynamics of competition.
 Right. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Admire Mvolwany of Terra Partners Asset Management.
 Good afternoon.
 and thanks for the call.
 my question is
 on these
 see him morir
 Registration
 I'm using the Ghana ID.
 from your experience
 possibly maybe in Nigeria and other countries
 how many
 sort of
 subscribers do you expect to lose
 who don't have the proper documentation to be able to re-register.
 And what will be the impact on the top line?
 Okay.
 Look, it's a very difficult question to answer concretely
 because of the stage we're at in the process.
 were right at the beginning of their
 SIM registration process, and we've already experienced a few teething challenges with
 the process itself.
 These have been ironed out.
 there's been some progress
 but they have still a few things to complete
 and so all operators
 are affected by the feeding challenges
 that I embrace.
 please.
 In terms of what's realistic till the end of March, a lot of that is based on how aggressive
 operators are, but also how responsive customers are to the demands for them to re-register.
 that we're seeing, you know, quite some good numbers reaching out to us.
 We've had over 2-point-something million customers already reach out to us to re-register,
 and I'm going through the process.
 We've had, you know, maybe 10%, 15% failure rates on the re-registration from that base.
 So there's activity happening, and this is even at a time when there are still some challenges.
 I guess to answer your question
 And, you know, I guess it's a bit premature to suggest and to, you know, to come up with numbers that may not register.
 So if we look at Nigeria, for example,
 and they had multiple extensions to SIM registration
 as a result of the number of people
 within the populace who had
 the national IED.
 It's a slightly different situation in Ghana here, where today you have over 50% of the
 30-something million, already with a national ID, and the effort to continue to register
 the balance is ongoing
 and the National ID Authority is expanding branches in all the regions
 so that that activity can take place.
 So we're in a slightly different place from what happened in Nigeria.
 I don't think we can directly compare the two situations.
 The Nigeria base that was registered as a percent of the population when SIM registration started was extremely low compared to the 50% we have in Ghana today.
 So different dynamics, but nonetheless, I do acknowledge the risk of losing subscribers at the end of the period.
 and I can assure you that we will do everything
 and throw everything at this to make sure we minimize the gap between the registered base
 and the non-registered base to the extent that we can.
 and we're taking this process very seriously
 and we've already come up with plans
 on how to get closer to
 customers so they don't have to
 the effort for customers to re-register
 is lower and because we're reaching out to them and setting up these temporary registration
 desks that were moving around the
 country. So there are a lot of things we're trying to put in place
 to make this as successful as it can be.
 Thank you.
 Thank you so much.
 My second question is that, I may be wrong, but I think last year,
 he was still able to
 role
 voice revenues in double digits
 and he suddenly dropped to over 2%.
 He's at Quentin.
 what would have happened
 And does this point to a position where voice revenues will start to decline?
 Right, so last year we grew voice in single digits, and we obviously had Quartez where
 we had double digits
 first two quarters of the year
 and then we saw a change in trend from Q3 to Q4 in single digits.
 But nonetheless, we've seen pressure on voice and there are a number of drivers on the voice
 trend.
 the first one is
 We're seeing a lot more people shift to behavior from being voice-centric towards data-centric services.
 So that's a natural evolution when people get smartphones and start to do more data services.
 But the second element is some of the initiatives that have been implemented as a result of the
 significant market power declaration.
 and the first one, the asymmetric
 at the end of last year, and on August 1st, the SMP on and off net parity application
 that went live on August 1st.
 All of these have had some pressure on voice, but I think the fundamental driver in terms
 of significance is really the
 consumer change
 and the acceleration of smartphone penetration within the network.
 Currently, we're sitting somewhere between 45% and 50%.
 And we've seen this trend reflected in other markets
 where the penetration gets to these levels
 where the voice utility starts to go down very fast in favor of data.
 Okay, so given that trend
 what sort of
 EBITDA margins are you focusing
 because traditionally data and mobile money are lower margin business lines compared to voice.
 You know, data is slightly lower than voice in terms of margin, if you have to separate the effects out, but we really don't separate it out.
 more money is actually a high margin
 high-margin product. So we continue to commit to expanded EBITDA margins. I believe we committed
 to that at the beginning of the year.
 that commitment is still in place
 and we believe we'll deliver on that for the end of the year.
 Okay, thank you.
 I think I'll join the queue if I have more questions.
 thank you
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Farouk Maya of AllAfrica Partners.
 Hi, guys. Thank you very much for the call.
 I have three questions
 um
 First question is just focused on the dynamics between your more and more subscriber numbers,
 the data, subscribers and voice
 and so we've seen the penetrations
 the percentage of voice subscribers
 who also happen to have data and normals, you know, increase over the last few years,
 but now it's starting to stall somewhat
 So I just want to check from your side, is that something that you're tracking?
 is that a key KPI
 The penetration of data compared to voice, and at the moment it's 47%, for example, data over voice.
 Is that a kind of very strong limit?
 and then the focus will turn to squeezing more money out of the existing subscriber base
 rather than continuing to grow it.
 That's question one.
 and I'll let you answer it before the questions.
 Okay.
 and it's probably
 worth
 us
 taking
 your
 numbers offline
 because we don't have those numbers that you just quoted.
 and I'm not too sure where you're getting those numbers from.
 But, yes, we do look at subscriber penetration across different products.
 yes, that's something we'll look at
 and look at how we balance our portfolio
 but it's not something we have disclosed
 So I'm not too sure how you're arriving at that conclusion.
 But I think it's fair to say that the subscribers that continue to use voice, a portion of them are starting to use more data.
 And that's the trend we're seeing.
 And they are still, you know, if you look at our voice contribution or voice share of total revenue, it's still in the 30% range, which is still very significant.
 So, voice is not, you know, any less significant than it was before, but obviously the year
 on year growth on voices where we're
 in the decline, so that leaves a slowdown.
 So just to clarify, my name is Olai Mentors.
 if you have 11
 11.9 million
 day to subscribers
 and you have 25 million
 voice subscribers
 so it's just one overdose there.
 that was what I meant
 and then just look around
 in terms of the...
 Just to link to that, in terms of the consumer journey,
 do you normally find that the voice subscriber
 firstly becomes a data subscriber
 and then a mobile money subscriber
 or it could be in any direction.
 And someone could have no data but still be doing more and more in some way.
 Yeah, it could really be in any direction.
 And, you know, to do data, you need a smartphone for the most part.
 We do have data users who do GPRS, but to a lesser extent.
 but to do data
 in our active numbers, using more than
 5 megabytes per second, you're
 99% certain to have a smartphone
 But you don't need that to be a more money customer.
 The second thing to note here is our data, our definition of data, active data subscribers,
 is that 11.9 that you quoted
 is based on a 30-day active usage
 and it's the same for moral money.
 But for our total subscriber base, it's based on a 90-day activity.
 So we're comparing slightly different bases when it comes to the 11.9 and 25.2.
 Okay.
 second
 question is
 obviously
 the number of subscribers
 for data and mobile money
 has been relatively slow compared to your previous higher growth.
 but the revenues are still very strong.
 So, which obviously points towards very higher, kind of higher usage from the existing users.
 how long can the
 Continue to play out, i.e. the existing users are being squeezed for basically more service
 versus a need to continue growing the subscriber base for data and mobile money,
 without which you'll see data and mobile money revenues starting to slow down.
 How much more, you know, room do you have just to squeeze the existing users?
 okay
 Let me put it this way.
 I mean, if I look at our growth levels for mobile money, today, I'll use the numbers of our total subs.
 We have about 10.6 million customers.
 So there's still, you know, significant room to grow customers in terms of new customers that come on board, right?
 almost doubling that amount
 in the coming years
 But a second dimension is the transactional behavior of these customers,
 And that's what you're talking about in terms of existing customers.
 Today, I mean, we're doing something like 6.7 average P2Ps per user per month.
 And if you take total transactions, it's somewhere in the early teens per user per month.
 And therefore, from a transactional behavior standpoint, that same number is upwards of 30 when you look at other markets like Kenya.
 So, existing users have a lot of room to grow in terms of transactional activity, but that
 wouldn't happen until there is
 a lot more ecosystem maturity.
 we've connected a lot more merchants
 We have about 200,000.
 We need to get that number to over a million, two million.
 we need to connect more services in totality
 so there are a number of ecosystems
 them opportunities that would
 allow the existing usage
 frequency to continue to increase significantly beyond where it is today so i don't i don't think
 we're anywhere close to cap in that
 opportunity
 but that doesn't take away
 the recognition
 that we need to accelerate our active user growth.
 And that's something we recognize, and this is where we have the plans in place,
 and coming out of Q3 into Q4 to find some permanence to drive in acquisition growth on the Malomani side.
 Okay, that's very clear.
 and just last question
 on capex i saw in the third quarter i think there's a bit of a pickup in capex versus the first half
 Could you maybe re-highlight guidance for the year and the medium-term guidance in terms of where you are in the CAPEX cycle?
 thank you very much
 Okay, so typically we deploy a significant portion of our CAPEX by the end of Q3.
 and this year has been a little bit more unique
 where we have
 you know,
 violence.
 20% of our deployments still happening in Q4.
 So our total capex for the year would be somewhere around $210 million.
 and we are
 in terms of commitment,
 And we are pretty much there, 99-point-something percent commitment on that value.
 So we're currently just implementing the balance of CapEx, and we should see the rest of the expansions happen through the last quarter, through this quarter.
 I think the final date of implementation is around third week to fourth week in November.
 Any guidance for the coming year on CapEx or coming few years?
 yes I think of CapEx
 absolute
 CAPEX number would be
 you're just about the same
 maybe about 5% higher to 6% higher,
 but it's in that same range of 210, I believe.
 will be somewhere
 in the $220 million to $230 million range.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Ali Anasar of Urgent Asset Management.
 Hi, Sloan.
 It's Sam
 Alice Collier
 I'm calling
 through Addy's line.
 I have a couple of questions
 the first one is
 Can you just help me understand the calculation behind average transaction per user per month on Momo?
 so I think in previous calls
 you said it was between five and seven
 that, you know,
 if we just take
 The total transaction
 Number and divide it by the
 Active user base
 It's a very different number
 So can you give us some clarity on that calculation?
 sure
 On previous calls, the 5 to 7 has been specifically average P2P per user per month.
 So that number is about 6.7 today.
 So we continue to see growth, but it's about 6.7.
 Everything else would be the total number of transactions on a unique user basis per user per month.
 So it would be difficult to use the total subs to do that calculation, I'm afraid.
 You would have to have specific scripts to tease out unique customers and unique transactions to do the division.
 That's why it'll probably re-consent to the numbers we have.
 Okay.
 so
 so in
 Internally, it's that P2P number that you guys are most focused on.
 That's correct, yeah. That's the one I've been quoting. So the 5 to 7 is on the P2P. Average P2P per user per month.
 Okay, understood.
 and then my other question as well
 Oh, sorry, it's again kind of a number question.
 we see a
 a pretty big difference
 between the TPV of Momo
 So,
 the market share
 that you guys have on a TPV basis.
 and the market share that's implied by total active users across all mobile money wallets in Ghana.
 and we're getting that ladder
 information from the communications authority
 data.
 I think they say there's about
 18 million active
 mobile money wallets
 whereas the market share you guys have
 On a TPV basis, you know, it's kind of mid-90%-ish.
 So do you have any idea why there's that massive discrepancy?
 because obviously it implies
 So there are lots of kind of active wallets out there
 that aren't really being used much.
 Do you have any insight?
 you know I think
 the well
 I believe that the metric you've seen from the communications authority is registered wallets, not active wallets.
 So just double-check that, because historically, when, you know, when one of them is registered,
 that it goes into a database and we present those numbers to the regulator.
 but it doesn't mean there's any activity
 There are also legacy registered wallets that were never used and that's still in the system.
 it's a cumulative number
 There's been no cleanup of that.
 So that number doesn't actually represent the degree of activity, which is why you're seeing these discrepancies.
 The second thing is also, and some of the numbers are quoted on a 90-day basis versus a 30-day activity,
 but I think this is really more the registered users versus the active users.
 Okay, interesting, because they say that there's 44 million registered users
 and 18 million active.
 so I
 I was just trying to tease out whether, you know,
 Would that come alongside the zero rating of one of your competitors, you know, whether you're kind of seeing anything there, anything on the ground?
 But it doesn't sound like you are
 Let me just invite Eli to comment on that.
 You may have more insights on that specifically.
 Thank you, Salom.
 The first thing is, like Shalom said,
 the data on
 the Bank of Ghana
 side or at the industry level
 is handled on a 90-day basis, whereas we report on a 30-day basis.
 So there's that difference in data.
 The second one is, it may be the latest data,
 But I don't have that.
 The third one is indeed the activity on our side is higher because of the portfolio of services that we do have on our platform for customers in terms of activity.
 So that also represents a higher activity on this side versus what you find on the platforms for the other providers.
 So, those three specific reasons could also feed into what feedback you have, but we'll
 try and get the latest data and also provide that as part of our next update. Thank you.
 Yeah, amazing.
 That would be great.
 And then if I could just squeeze in one really quick one as well, please, Salome.
 can you just remind us
 what you guys are doing
 in terms of lending products?
 Are you getting much traction there?
 anything
 And I think you can kind of talk about that.
 sure
 I'll have Ellie share thoughts on the lending products as well.
 Elite is going.
 Okay. Thank you, Salom.
 who default in in the loan repayment and improve upon the level of recoveries
 that we have on that side.
 But otherwise, we've seen three partners already.
 Today we work with
 the show
 go or AFB, we work with
 EchoBank and we work with
 APSA in terms
 of the partners who support the loan portfolio.
 I don't know if that addresses your question.
 Anything you could say about the
 size of that
 product or is
 that still kind
 of confidential
 the size
 today I don't have
 I don't know.
 specifics on the on the daily loan that we give out but that number keeps
 improving. We shall once again
 provide that on the next call.
 Thank you.
 Okay, great.
 That's all from me.
 Thanks, guys.
 Thank you.
 The final question comes from Brad Wibitski of Equinox Partners.
 Hi, there's two quick questions for me.
 Um, first is, uh, what's, what's driving the growth in other, in your other expenses line?
 and then the second question is
 I'm curious whether your market share is different.
 between
 P2P mobile money transactions
 and
 I guess
 P to C or B to C
 or the value-added services.
 Yeah, let me address the second question, and I'll have Kobi answer the question of the expenses on the other line, the growth in the other line, other expenses line.
 So today we don't have market information to be able to give market share by product, as you've described it.
 So it's very difficult to know what the market share by P2P, B2C, P2B is at the moment.
 so what we'll have is typically what the
 transacted value share is which
 gives a strong indication of what's being transacted on the platform, an indication
 of the share across the product.
 So that's maybe a proxy for P2P activity, but it's absolutely not certain.
 Cobby, do you want to take the question on the expenses line?
 Okay, I think we've lost copy.
 we can take that question
 offline if you can just reach out to me
 after the call.
 I'll be grateful.
 Thank you, Jeremy.
 All right.
 Thank you, guys.
 Apologies.
 Thank you.
 Ladies and gentlemen, that was a part of your question.
 I'll hand over back for closing comments.
 okay
 thank you everyone
 and apologies for the
 eight minutes extension
 but thank you for making time for today's call
 I know they are unanswered questions, so just please reach out to me after the call
 and I'll be glad to assist.
 Thank you, and you may not have disconnect from the call.
 Thank you very much, gentlemen.
 ladies and gentlemen
 That concludes today's conference.
 Thank you for joining us.
 You may now disconnect your lines.

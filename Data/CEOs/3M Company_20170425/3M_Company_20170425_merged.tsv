0	8520	things. Nick. Thanks, Inga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap
8520	15120	of our first quarter sales performance. As Inga mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in
15120	26140	the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic
26140	33460	businesses, reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales
33460	42300	by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7%
42300	49660	versus last year. As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across
49660	56780	all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%,
56780	64500	led by mid-single-digit increases in both industrial and safety and graphics. Our electronics and energy
64500	71900	and healthcare businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The consumer business
71900	78180	declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market,
78180	85140	as Inga mentioned. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%.
85140	91300	All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in
91300	97680	electronics and energy. We also had strong growth in industrial, healthcare, and consumer.
99000	106400	Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China, Hong Kong,
106400	115300	and Japan. Excluding our electronics businesses, China-Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%.
115860	125180	Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically,
125660	132560	with sales growth led by industrial and safety and graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa
132560	142680	grew nearly 2%. Finally, organic growth in Latin America-Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit
142680	149680	growth in healthcare, along with solid growth in consumer and safety and graphics. At a country level,
149900	159560	Mexico continued to deliver strong growth at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%.
159560	167580	Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales
167580	179540	were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAP operating margins were 23.1%,
179540	188840	down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1. Earlier, you heard Inga mention the additional $136 million
188840	196440	of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and
196440	203000	productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points
203000	208300	year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance.
209280	214480	Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter.
214480	222440	Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins.
223640	228980	Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points.
230180	235760	Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered
235760	238560	savings in excess of market price changes.
238560	245860	We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive
245860	247120	for the full year.
248000	254760	Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points
254760	255360	in the quarter.
256360	264140	As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension
264140	268660	and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year-on-year.
269140	276460	Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points.
277500	281400	Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share.
283280	290020	First quarter, gap earnings increased 5.4% to $2.16 per share.
290020	298420	The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings.
299240	303680	Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts.
304840	309500	The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share.
310580	317840	Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments
317840	319440	were a $0.16 impact.
320020	328100	The first quarter tax rate was 23.7% versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter,
328500	331260	which increased earnings by $0.09 per share.
331920	337040	The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix,
337780	341540	increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation,
342200	344600	and ongoing strategic tax initiatives.
344600	355080	In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%.
355080	362740	Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year-on-year,
363140	366020	which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share.
366020	370260	Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow.
372100	375800	We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company,
376100	381980	which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders.
381980	390180	First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year-on-year,
390620	393660	largely due to the timing of pension contributions.
394720	402000	Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 to $500 million,
402000	404140	similar to 2016.
405180	409460	Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year,
409460	416460	we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%.
416460	421680	Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year.
422880	426880	First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million,
427520	430560	in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.
430560	438360	For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 to $1.5 billion.
439160	445320	As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%,
445320	451740	resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter.
452460	458220	We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases.
458220	464840	We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 to $4.5 billion.
466560	472340	Let's now review our performance by business group, starting with Industrial on slide 11.
474360	477860	Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4,
477860	485640	delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically.
486700	491620	Industrial's growth was broad-based across all businesses and geographic areas.
492620	497860	Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial,
498660	500720	increasing double digits organically.
500720	507900	Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points.
509000	513360	Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits.
513920	520540	Our heartlanded businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes,
520940	525640	and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically.
525640	532240	On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits,
532820	536540	while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits.
537500	542180	Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million,
542920	545640	with operating margins of 23.1%.
546300	550360	Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-on-year,
550360	556640	or up 40 basis points, adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain.
557580	561820	As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017.
562820	568280	For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%,
568280	571360	versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%.
572060	574660	Please turn to slide 12.
574660	582720	First quarter sales and safety and graphics were up 4.8% organically, to $1.5 billion.

587140	590560	delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits,
590780	594300	with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S.
595080	599320	The Rook and Granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter,
599320	605680	posting double-digit organic growth as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market.
607080	611080	Geographically, safety and graphics grew organically in all areas,
611560	616900	led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S.
618340	622160	Operating income for the business group was $399 million,
622160	628960	and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%.
628960	635020	Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last,
635260	637960	operating margins were up 80 basis points.
638820	642840	As with Industrial, safety and graphics is off to a strong start,
643320	646500	and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year.
646500	652500	We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5%,
652500	655740	versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%.
655740	659140	Please turn to slide 13.

669960	673960	in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%.
673960	680080	Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety.
681160	683020	Our medical consumables businesses,
683400	686020	which represent the largest segment within healthcare,
686500	688160	posted good growth in Q1.
689520	693660	Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter,
693660	697060	a marked improvement from the second half of 2016.
698340	702720	Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically.
702720	706060	We expect the business to improve throughout the year.
707680	712100	Geographically, organic growth in healthcare was positive in all areas,
712680	717080	led by high single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada, and Asia Pacific.
717760	720500	We saw notable strength in China-Hong Kong,
720720	722640	which was up double digits in the quarter.
723900	727540	Healthcare's operating income was $434 million,
727540	731620	and margins remained strong at 30.5%.
731620	734920	Importantly, we generated these returns
734920	737380	while investing an additional $21 million
737380	741800	to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.
742500	744100	Please turn to slide 14.

754760	759840	The electronic side of the business grew 18% organically,
760180	763260	as our team successfully drove increased penetration
763260	765500	on a number of OEM platforms.
766420	769120	Demand strengthened across most market segments
769120	770380	in consumer electronics,
770720	773160	which also boosted our growth rate,
773420	776500	and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps.
777320	781120	Our energy-related businesses were up 1% organically,
781120	784720	with low single-digit growth in electrical markets,
785300	786480	while telecom was flat.
787300	788820	On a geographic basis,

812800	815400	up 600 basis points year-on-year.
816060	817300	As you can see,
817480	819900	Q1 organic growth was very robust
819900	821360	for electronics and energy.
822000	822720	As a result,
823120	825940	we are updating our full-year growth expectations
825940	827060	for this business
827060	830220	to a range of up 1% to 6%,
830220	834480	versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%.
834480	836560	The first half of the year
836560	839120	is expected to be stronger than the second half,
839640	841900	largely driven by year-on-year comps.
842860	844580	Please turn to slide 15.
846280	849180	First quarter sales and consumer were $1 billion,
849840	853340	and organic growth declined 1.2% year-on-year.
854340	856680	Three of our four businesses within consumer
856680	857900	grew organically,
858540	860100	again led by home improvement,
860420	862900	followed by consumer health care and home care.
862900	865840	Within the home improvement business,
866260	868760	our command damage-free mounting products
868760	870940	posted strong double-digit growth
870940	874220	as accelerated investments continued to pay off.
875100	878220	Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter.
879360	881220	More than offsetting this growth
881220	882820	was a year-on-year decline
882820	885560	in our stationary and office supplies business,
886060	889720	which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions,
889720	893760	primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale.
895760	896400	Geographically,
897520	898800	organic growth in consumer
898800	901920	was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America Canada,
902260	905000	which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S.
906280	909080	Operating income was $222 million,
909760	912720	with operating margins of 21.3%.
912720	915580	Looking at the full year,
916180	918440	we expect organic growth for consumer
918440	920860	to be in the range of 1% to 3%
920860	924340	versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%.
924340	927220	We also expect to see growth improve
927220	928400	as the year progresses.
929580	931180	Please turn to slide 16.
933260	934620	Before I turn it back to Inga,
934720	936700	let me address a few items
936700	938180	that we anticipate will happen
938180	939960	over the remainder of 2017.
939960	942800	The net impact of these items
942800	945400	is factored into our EPS guidance today.
946460	948000	First, as you may recall,
948140	948720	in December,
948980	950340	we announced the divestiture
950340	952540	of our identity management business
952540	954120	within Safety and Graphics.
955160	956520	The sale of this business,
957040	958440	which has annual sales
958440	960380	of approximately $205 million,
961000	962680	is expected to close
962680	963920	during the second quarter.
964940	965980	Upon completion,
966660	968420	we expect to record a gain
968420	971600	on sale of approximately $0.55 per share,
972500	974180	partially offset by the profit
974180	976440	that will go with the business in 2017
976440	978980	after the divestiture is closed.
979960	980580	In addition,
981520	983120	recall at our investor meeting
983120	984580	in March of 2016,
985260	986840	we introduced a plan
986840	988860	to better optimize our portfolio
988860	990560	and supply chain footprint.
991100	993780	We expect to make significant progress
993780	995520	on that plan in 2017
995520	998000	with associated costs
998000	1000980	in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share
1000980	1002960	over the remainder of the year.
1003960	1007740	We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share
1007740	1009680	will incur in Q2.
1010620	1011580	In total,
1012060	1013760	the net impact of these items
1013760	1015120	is expected to add
1015120	1016620	between $0.05 and $0.10
1016620	1019140	to 2017 earnings per share.
1019140	1020060	Again,
1020660	1022160	this impact is reflected
1022160	1024500	in our full year updated guidance,
1025100	1026360	which Inga will now cover
1026360	1027540	on slide 17.
1028580	1029000	Inga?
1029760	1031180	To acknowledge your request.
1031820	1032300	Yeah, Andy,
1032360	1033240	thanks for the question.
1033520	1035120	You covered quite a few things there.
1035780	1038120	Just from an overall theme standpoint,
1038460	1038660	Andy,
1038780	1040740	we're always looking for opportunities
1040740	1042560	to enhance the value of the enterprise,
1042700	1043640	and that's really part
1043640	1044640	of our business model.
1045420	1048320	What you see in the first quarter
1048320	1050900	for incremental investments,
1051600	1053460	some of that was investments
1053460	1056600	we were taking to accelerate growth,
1056720	1058080	and that was really lined up
1058080	1059820	with what we had shared last December
1059820	1062120	of the incremental $100 million
1062120	1064040	over the course of 2017
1064040	1066060	to deliver accelerated growth
1066060	1067620	throughout the year.
1068840	1071440	The other context I'd share with you
1071440	1073060	in thinking about this step-up
1073060	1075020	in strategic investments.
1075160	1077600	If you think back to last March
1077600	1078720	at our investor meeting
1078720	1079780	when we laid out
1079780	1081540	our five-year plan,
1082220	1083640	we shared plans
1083640	1086340	for optimizing our portfolio
1086340	1087620	and supply chain footprint
1087620	1089440	with, at that time,
1089500	1090280	what we described,
1090420	1092060	a total of between
1092060	1093920	$500 and $600 million
1093920	1095420	of investments,
1095420	1096900	and ultimately
1096900	1099560	that we expected that
1099560	1100440	by 2020
1100440	1101300	to be creating
1101300	1104500	$125 to $175 million
1104500	1106180	of annualized benefit,
1106480	1107740	operating income benefit.
1108300	1109320	What you're seeing
1109320	1110340	in this step-up
1110340	1113440	of accelerated strategic investments,
1113600	1114820	both for the quarter
1114820	1116220	and for the year,
1117000	1120240	is us taking more action
1120240	1121220	related to that,
1121960	1123780	what we laid out last year
1123780	1125720	for the optimized actions
1125720	1127360	on our supply chain footprint.
1127980	1128560	Yeah, Joe,
1128700	1130780	as the quarter went on,
1131000	1133040	it was consistent strength
1133040	1134240	across the quarter,
1134440	1135340	all three months
1135340	1135940	of the quarter.
1137440	1138860	And I'd further add,
1138940	1139940	we're seeing April,
1140180	1141020	the start of April,
1141240	1143240	tracking very much in line
1143240	1144400	with what we've been seeing
1144400	1146700	for the first quarter.
1146700	1148900	So, really no
1148900	1150260	inter-quarter
1150260	1151980	trend changes.
1152380	1152920	Yeah, Julian,
1153100	1155980	we're not fundamentally
1155980	1157120	seeing any change
1157120	1158200	in our pricing power.
1158360	1159660	That remains strong.
1160040	1161040	We do continue
1161040	1162900	to look for targeted places
1162900	1163660	where we can
1163660	1165320	use price
1165320	1167160	to help drive
1167160	1168520	organic volume growth.
1169120	1170160	If I look out
1170160	1172000	over total 2017,
1172000	1173720	we're still,
1174020	1175300	we're expecting
1175300	1177860	U.S. price growth
1177860	1179340	to be approximately flat.
1179720	1180580	If I expand it
1180580	1181720	to the total globe,
1182760	1184480	if I pull out
1184480	1185380	the FX impact,
1185540	1186400	we expect pricing
1186400	1187700	to be up slightly.
1188160	1189260	Our normal range
1189260	1191080	is 30 to 50 basis points
1191080	1192160	of core price growth.
1192820	1193540	I think it'll be
1193540	1194680	somewhere between there
1194680	1195400	and flat
1195400	1196900	for total 2017.
1196900	1200380	Yeah,
1200560	1202660	the $136 million
1202660	1204920	in strategic investments
1204920	1205920	in the first quarter,
1206100	1206400	Julian,
1206980	1208280	a little less
1208280	1209260	than half of that
1209260	1211340	is investments
1211340	1212120	that we see
1212120	1213680	having a fairly
1213680	1214920	short-term return
1214920	1216340	in 2017
1216340	1216840	and then
1216840	1218160	into early 2018.
1219080	1220100	And those are
1220100	1221720	primarily growth-oriented
1221720	1222640	investments
1222640	1224660	and those growth-oriented
1224660	1225400	investments
1225400	1226080	were factored
1226080	1226900	into the guidance
1226900	1227520	we set out
1227520	1228440	for the year.
1228860	1229660	The remainder
1229660	1231800	of the strategic investments,
1232360	1233180	those relate
1233180	1235180	to our portfolio,
1235660	1236740	supply chain footprint,
1237360	1237960	and that's really
1237960	1238860	laid out,
1239240	1240120	aligned closely
1240120	1240760	with the plan
1240760	1241820	that we put forward.
1244120	1244480	Yeah,
1244620	1245100	so when we,
1245360	1246280	in December
1246280	1247080	when we laid out
1247080	1248080	our guidance,
1248520	1249340	EPS guidance
1249340	1250060	for the year,
1250620	1251660	strategic investments
1251660	1252300	we had
1252300	1253760	incrementally
1253760	1255780	in a 5 to 10 cent range.
1256080	1257340	that was aligned
1257340	1258180	primarily
1258180	1259360	or almost exclusively
1259360	1260220	with our
1260220	1261700	growth investments.
1262580	1263660	Now what you're seeing,
1264040	1265180	we're seeing the growth
1265180	1266200	investments play out
1266200	1267580	exactly as we guided,
1267800	1269800	still in that 5 to 10 cent range
1269800	1270660	for the total year.
1271160	1272000	What we're layering
1272000	1273100	on top of that
1273100	1275760	is additional footprint
1275760	1276880	actions that were,
1277160	1278400	and portfolio actions
1278400	1279020	that were taken
1279020	1281140	throughout 2017.
1282140	1283480	So on top
1283480	1284560	of the growth investments,
1284700	1285160	there's roughly
1285160	1286020	an incremental
1286020	1286760	10 cents
1286760	1287760	of supply chain
1287760	1289300	and portfolio actions
1289300	1289940	that we took
1289940	1291340	in the first quarter
1291340	1292480	of 2017.
1293280	1294020	And then in terms
1294020	1294800	of the guidance
1294800	1295820	for the bounce
1295820	1296640	of this year,
1297400	1298380	for Q2,
1298560	1298780	3,
1298840	1299200	and 4,
1299300	1300020	there's an extra
1300020	1302200	40 to 45 cents
1302200	1303180	on top of that
1303180	1304400	that was not part
1304400	1305720	of our initial guidance.
1305720	1307320	So all in,
1308040	1309980	the growth investments,
1310200	1310920	the incremental
1310920	1312520	10 that we took
1312520	1313400	in the first quarter
1313400	1314600	plus what we're expecting
1314600	1316780	Q2 through Q4,
1317180	1318160	it's now in the range
1318160	1320400	of 55 to 65 cents
1320400	1321240	for the total year.
1321360	1321760	Nigel,
1321820	1322440	we're always,
1322820	1323620	as I said earlier,
1323720	1324420	we're always looking
1324420	1325400	for opportunities.
1326780	1327740	The level
1327740	1328820	that we were investing
1328820	1329560	in Q1
1329560	1330760	in strategic investments
1330760	1331580	around growth,
1331960	1333200	no pull forward there.
1333320	1333960	That's coming
1333960	1335560	exactly as we had planned.
1336240	1337320	The increased
1337320	1338560	strategic investments
1338560	1340120	around portfolio actions
1340120	1341880	and supply chain footprint,
1342880	1345040	that's aligned
1345040	1346560	with our longer term vision.
1347120	1348220	The exact timing
1348220	1348900	of when we were
1348900	1349920	going to do that,
1350240	1352200	we did not have clarity
1352200	1353800	on until we started
1353800	1354580	pulling the trigger
1354580	1355760	on some of those actions
1355760	1356700	in the first quarter
1356700	1358280	and some that we expect
1358280	1359000	to have happen
1359000	1360200	over the next three quarters.
1360760	1361600	So I'm not sure
1361600	1362700	I'd characterize it
1362700	1364880	as a pull forward
1364880	1366800	as much as it would be.
1366920	1367780	Now is the time
1367780	1368780	that it looked like
1368780	1369380	the right time
1369380	1370180	for us to pull
1370180	1371720	the trigger on actions
1371720	1373160	that we had laid out
1373160	1374960	last March.
1375100	1375340	No,
1375480	1377480	the 40 to 45 cents
1377480	1378620	does not include
1378620	1380900	anything for Scott Safety.
1381320	1381920	At the time
1381920	1383380	that closes,
1383820	1385920	we will update guidance
1385920	1387040	to take into account
1387040	1388780	any impact
1388780	1389440	that we'll have
1389440	1390860	on our 2017 earnings.
1390860	1392640	In our industrial channel,
1393100	1394100	we are seeing
1394100	1395400	increased confidence
1395400	1396920	in the channel,
1397060	1398040	which we are seeing,
1399700	1400300	while we're seeing
1400300	1401600	good sellouts
1401600	1402200	of our product,
1402320	1402680	we're seeing
1402680	1405260	even stronger sell
1405260	1408040	into the industrial channel,
1408160	1409440	primarily in the U.S.
1409440	1410980	So that is one place
1410980	1412000	where we're attributing
1412000	1413180	it to higher confidence
1413180	1414280	amongst that channel
1414280	1415620	and seeing what appears
1415620	1416820	to be some restocking
1416820	1419120	of depleted channel levels
1419120	1419660	that we've seen
1419660	1420280	in the past.
1421860	1422380	Jeff,
1422460	1423580	to your first question
1423580	1425560	on the tax rate
1425560	1427520	for what we're now seeing
1427520	1429160	for total 2017,
1429980	1431400	there's a few dynamics
1431400	1431980	going on.
1432120	1432900	First of all,
1433920	1434920	we are seeing
1434920	1436220	a favorable
1436220	1438480	geographic profit mix
1438480	1439040	for us
1439040	1440480	that is helping us
1440480	1441620	in our tax rate.
1441680	1442560	It's been a headwind
1442560	1443460	for us the last
1443460	1444660	couple of years,
1444760	1445660	and that's switching over
1445660	1446480	to a tailwind
1446480	1447440	for us this year.
1448000	1448760	We're also seeing
1448760	1449720	some of the benefits
1449720	1451740	as you'd expect
1451740	1452860	from some of our
1452860	1454040	tax planning,
1454740	1456700	but one of the more
1456700	1457640	significant items
1457640	1458960	just in the first quarter
1458960	1460220	is the benefit
1460220	1460760	we're getting
1460760	1462920	from the accounting
1462920	1464200	standard change
1464200	1466580	that came into effect
1466580	1467400	last year
1467400	1470260	for the excess tax benefits
1470260	1472300	from stock-based compensation.
1472300	1474480	from a year-on-year basis,
1474480	1475060	that's about
1475060	1476760	a four-cent benefit
1476760	1477900	versus what we had
1477900	1479180	a year ago.
1480140	1480420	And,
1480540	1481280	Jeff,
1481340	1481980	I'd say that's
1481980	1482720	the wild card.
1482860	1483400	Other things
1483400	1483940	are going
1483940	1485980	very much
1485980	1486960	as we had planned
1486960	1487700	to get to the
1487700	1489320	27% tax rate
1489320	1490780	by 2020,
1491400	1492880	but with the
1492880	1494500	added variability
1494500	1495540	from what happens
1495540	1496640	with this excess
1496640	1497860	tax benefit
1497860	1498680	from stock-based
1498680	1499400	compensation,
1499400	1500320	there'll be
1500320	1500920	some quarters
1500920	1502080	that's a benefit
1502080	1502820	and some quarters
1502820	1503380	we won't see
1503380	1504460	any benefit at all.
1505200	1505840	All in,
1506320	1507400	we're well on track
1507400	1508340	for hitting
1508340	1509500	the 27%
1509500	1511680	in 2020,
1512240	1513180	possibly even
1513180	1514000	lower than that,
1514100	1515260	but when we have
1515260	1516000	better clarity
1516000	1516480	on that,
1516580	1517960	we'll give a revised
1517960	1518780	number of
1518780	1519760	can that go
1519760	1520340	even lower
1520340	1521400	than the 27%.
1521400	1525000	To the
1525000	1526140	second point
1526140	1526560	on the
1526560	1527160	strategic
1527160	1528100	investments,
1528240	1529680	the $136 million,
1530800	1533060	of the growth-related
1533060	1533880	investments,
1534520	1535060	you're correct,
1535160	1535720	health care
1535720	1537340	had the
1537340	1538200	majority
1538200	1539480	of that.
1539780	1540180	There were
1540180	1541200	small amounts,
1541640	1542300	single digits
1542300	1542860	of millions
1542860	1543460	of dollars,
1544200	1544540	low to
1544540	1545640	mid-single digits
1545640	1546140	and millions
1546140	1546560	of dollars
1546560	1547080	in the other
1547080	1547780	four business
1547780	1548160	groups,
1548160	1549200	and then
1549200	1549740	from a
1549740	1550800	portfolio
1550800	1552560	and supply
1552560	1553320	chain footprint
1553320	1554200	optimization,
1554940	1555660	the vast
1555660	1556440	majority of
1556440	1556820	that is
1556820	1557420	impacting
1557420	1558300	the
1558300	1559520	electronics
1559520	1560080	and energy
1560080	1560640	business
1560640	1561660	with a little
1561660	1562180	of that
1562180	1563000	hitting the
1563000	1563520	consumer
1563520	1565020	and office
1565020	1565540	business,
1566160	1566680	the consumer
1566680	1567380	business group.
1568800	1568980	Yeah,
1569040	1569540	Rob,
1569720	1569920	we,
1571320	1572200	as far as
1572200	1573040	the automation
1573040	1574100	portion of our
1574100	1574980	CapEx spending,
1575440	1576140	a year ago
1576140	1576920	at our investor
1576920	1577280	meeting,
1577380	1577880	we laid out
1577880	1578160	that we
1578160	1578840	expected that
1578840	1579160	to be
1579160	1580800	a noticeable
1580800	1581760	part of our
1581760	1582780	CapEx investments.
1582960	1583300	What we're
1583300	1583960	seeing is
1583960	1584660	that's playing
1584660	1585400	out exactly
1585400	1586360	as we laid
1586360	1586840	out a year
1586840	1587140	ago,
1587240	1588100	that we're
1588100	1588360	seeing
1588360	1588920	continued
1588920	1589660	opportunities
1589660	1591420	for automation
1591420	1593020	investments
1593020	1593640	within our
1593640	1595140	CapEx plans,
1595440	1596480	and I
1596480	1596940	wouldn't call
1596940	1597240	it an
1597240	1597780	uptick,
1598020	1598340	but I'd
1598340	1598660	say it's
1598660	1599660	playing out
1599660	1600380	exactly as
1600380	1600940	we laid
1600940	1601220	out.
1603160	1603720	Supply
1603720	1604480	chain and
1604480	1605100	portfolio
1605100	1606160	optimization,
1606960	1607520	and much
1607520	1608160	less around
1608160	1608720	growth.
1609760	1610440	If we
1610440	1611100	see growth
1611100	1613000	even higher
1613000	1613840	than what
1613840	1614660	we're currently
1614660	1615300	expecting,
1615820	1616280	could our
1616280	1616620	growth
1616620	1617280	investments
1617280	1617780	tick up
1617780	1618160	some?
1618720	1619100	I think
1619100	1620280	the short
1620280	1620800	answer is
1620800	1621040	yes,
1621080	1621440	it could
1621440	1622080	tick up
1622080	1622540	some,
1622760	1623240	but I
1623240	1623700	don't think
1623700	1624320	on a
1624320	1624760	material
1624760	1625400	basis.
1625960	1626200	I think
1626200	1626520	we're now
1626520	1626960	talking
1626960	1629380	single digits
1629380	1629940	of pennies
1629940	1630280	at that
1630280	1630520	point.
1630520	1630900	thanks,
1630960	1631140	Steve.
1632740	1633040	Yeah,
1633140	1633340	Steve,
1633420	1634140	thanks for
1634140	1634700	the question.
1635960	1636600	Part of
1636600	1637020	what we
1637020	1637680	talked about
1637680	1638260	a little
1638260	1638720	over a
1638720	1639320	year ago
1639320	1640540	at our
1640540	1641080	outlook
1641080	1642840	meeting for
1642840	1643600	the five-year
1643600	1643900	outlook
1643900	1645360	meeting is
1645360	1646380	the number
1646380	1647500	of manufacturing
1647500	1648180	sites we
1648180	1648680	have around
1648680	1649320	the world
1649320	1650940	and looking
1650940	1651600	at the
1651600	1652640	productivity
1652640	1653360	in those
1653360	1653860	sites and
1653860	1654580	the opportunity
1654580	1655340	we have
1655340	1656260	through
1656260	1657880	rationalizing
1657880	1659400	the number
1659400	1659900	of those
1659900	1660340	sites,
1660900	1661540	increasing
1661540	1662460	capital into
1662460	1663000	some of
1663000	1663620	our more
1663620	1664060	productive
1664060	1664580	sites,
1665200	1666140	the opportunity
1666140	1667040	to reduce
1667040	1667640	the total
1667640	1669720	footprint of
1669720	1670580	our manufacturing
1670580	1671260	and supply
1671260	1671780	chain
1671780	1674820	sites over
1674820	1675300	the course
1675300	1675800	of the next
1675800	1676480	four years.
1676740	1677580	So that's
1677580	1678080	what we mean
1678080	1678660	when we talk
1678660	1679060	about it
1679060	1679340	when we
1679340	1679760	laid out
1679760	1681000	a $500
1681000	1681600	to $600
1681600	1682940	million investment
1682940	1683400	that we
1683400	1684000	expect to
1684000	1684320	take.
1684720	1685380	The resulting
1685380	1686160	productivity
1686160	1686920	from that
1686920	1687600	that by
1687600	1687940	the time
1687940	1688240	we get
1688240	1688880	to 2020
1688880	1689360	we think
1689360	1689700	that will
1689700	1690740	add another
1690740	1691820	$125 to
1691820	1692680	$175
1692680	1693780	million of
1693780	1695080	added operating
1695080	1695760	income to
1695760	1697180	that productivity
1697180	1698080	we can get
1698080	1698440	through.
1698820	1699440	Look at this
1699440	1700080	globally,
1700400	1700660	Steve.
1700800	1701560	We had a
1701560	1702340	positive,
1702620	1703040	though very
1703040	1704040	small price
1704040	1706720	in all
1706720	1707280	businesses
1707280	1707960	except for
1707960	1708320	healthcare
1708320	1708840	where we
1708840	1709360	were flat.
1709360	1710440	To the
1710440	1711160	first question
1711160	1712960	on business,
1713520	1714120	and I'll go
1714120	1714660	further in
1714660	1715240	geography,
1715240	1716940	we expect
1716940	1717820	that this
1717820	1719500	action that
1719500	1719980	we're taking
1719980	1720300	in the
1720300	1721000	second quarter
1721000	1721580	and in
1721580	1721920	the third
1721920	1722320	and fourth
1722320	1722740	quarter
1722740	1725020	will impact
1725020	1726660	all businesses
1726660	1727300	and all
1727300	1728100	geographies,
1728300	1730100	that it will
1730100	1731740	be broad.
1732060	1732600	As far as
1732600	1733300	the specific
1733300	1734400	details of
1734400	1735680	each business,
1736040	1737060	we're still
1737060	1737620	working through
1737620	1738320	those details.
1738460	1738740	We're not
1738740	1739840	ready to be
1739840	1740440	sharing that
1740440	1740800	yet,
1740800	1741780	Lawrence.
1741780	1744040	And then
1744040	1745060	as far as
1745060	1745820	the 17
1745820	1746740	to 18,
1747300	1747760	some of
1747760	1748380	these actions
1748380	1748860	will have
1748860	1749420	a tail
1749420	1750460	into 18
1750460	1750960	where there
1750960	1751480	will be
1751480	1752720	residual cost
1752720	1753320	impact
1753320	1754580	hitting us
1754580	1755120	in 18,
1755580	1755980	though I
1755980	1757080	expect it
1757080	1758280	will not,
1758660	1759660	I very much
1759660	1760180	expect it
1760180	1760640	will be a
1760640	1761400	decline from
1761400	1761860	the level
1761860	1762620	that we're
1762620	1763400	projecting now
1763400	1764280	for 2017.
1764280	1764420	you.

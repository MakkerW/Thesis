 As you will see in Antonio's presentation, our results for the quarter were strong.
 The Q2 results are a clear example that our strategic planning has been well executed
 with the right focus and discipline, showing significant improvement in our financial
 performance.
 Before we go into more details regarding the Q2 results, I'd like to highlight the good
 the momentum we are going in the different business segments.
 In commercial aviation, we announced a new firm order for third E-195, E-2 jets from
 the Canadian porter airlines, with purchase rights for 50 more aircraft.
 We also announced new firm orders for 34 E175 jets to Horizon Air and Sky West to be operated
 for Laska Airlines and Delta Airlines.

 We maintained our price discipline strategy and had a strong backlog growth with book
 to build in excess of 2 to 1 for this business.
 In defense and security, we delivered seven Super Tucano aircraft in the first half of
 the year.
 Also, we had strong performance in our cybersecurity and systems integration companies, with double
 digital revenue growth in the first half of this year.

 Have you now?
 over to Antonio Garcia, our CFO, to give further details on the financial results and I will

 Thank you.
 Thank you, Francisco. And good morning, everyone.
 I will start for our backlog for the quarter.
 On slide 7, the graph shows we ended the second quarter at 59 billion.
 Up.
 1.7 billion or 12% from the prior quarter.
 This represents a return to the same 15.9 billion we were at in 2020, before the pandemic
 began. In our commercial aviation business, we close 48 aircraft sails in a quarter and
 spread across several different airlines. In executive aviation, we had to record second
 quarter sales. A solid backlog as demand for lights and larger business jets continue
 to grow.
 blogging service and support and defense and security also grew from the prior quarters
 level.
 In summary, it was the best sales quarter since mid-2019.
 Please give us confidence in our plans for future revenue growth and improvements.

 both well above prior years level.
 This improvement comes from several factors, including higher deliveries resulting higher
 revenue, better gross margin on improved pricing, mixed production efficiency, fixed cost leveraged
 on higher volumes and favorable tax obligations, a reversal of this quarter of approximately
 25 million. All of our segments have much better performance in the second
 quarter. Adjusted a bit margin by segment in the second quarter were as follows.
 Commercial aviation was at 1.7% negative,
 which, although negative, shows a great improvement
 from last year.
 Executive Aviation was at positive 8% with a strong price discipline and consistent profitability.
 Defense and security was at positive 25 percent, led by Super Tucano delivers along with positive
 adjustments on certain defense contracts.
 service and support was at 19% as a strong contribution from spare parts programs.
 If slide 12 shows our adjusted net income, it was positive 44 million or 24 cents per

 represents the first net profit on a quarterly basis since 2018.
 The recovering adjusted net income is primarily driven by improved operating margins, reductions
 in financial leverage also contributes to improved profitability and any future debt
 reduction would naturally have any additional positive impact on earnings.
 Moving to slide 13. I'd like to begin with free cash flow
 Free cash flow in the second quarter was positive for the five million
 272 million higher than first quarter, and 570 million higher than the same period of
 last year. This is a remarkable achievement. Although year-to-date, the cash flow is negative
 of 181 million. This is compared with a freakish flowboard of around a billion of the first
 of 2020.
 We expect positive free cash flow from the second half of the year of the 2021 as indicated
 in this morning guidance.
 Now to investments.
 Our total investment were 50 million in the second quarter and 89 million year-to-date
 both of which are in line with last year levels.
 This is important because it shows we continue to invest our future.
 We have been very judicious in balancing the need to invest our future with the needed

 our average depth maturity remains at four years.
 We expect to continue to generate cash in the second half of 2021.
 And beyond so, our leverage will naturally decrease.
 This will, correspondingly, reduce our net interest
 and have an additional positive impact on their income.
 Finally, move it to a slide 16.

 representing a low double dividend growth
 at the midpoint compared to the last year.
 Adjust the BIT margin should be in the range of 3% to 4% and adjust the BIT for 2021 should
 be between 8.5 to 9.5 percent.
 Embraer has had, in the first half of 2020,
 margin in these ranks, as we expect this good margins to repeat in the second half of the
 year.
 It's important to mention that those margins includes costs related to the integration
 of commercial aviation, as well as spaces related
 to the arbitration process.

 of 150 million to a break even for 2021.
 We had 181 million of free cash flow users in the first half of the year.
 So we are anticipating a bear to generate up to 180 million cash in the second half of
 of 2021 without any cash inflows from MNA projects.
 With that, I conclude my presentation and hand it back over to Francisco for his final

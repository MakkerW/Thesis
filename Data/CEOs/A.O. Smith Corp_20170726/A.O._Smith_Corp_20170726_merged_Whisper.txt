 The increase in sales was primarily due to higher volumes of commercial water heaters
 and boilers in the U.S. and pricing actions in August 2016 related to steel cost increases
 and inflationary pressure, another cost.

 corporate expenses were essentially the same as one year ago. Our effective income tax
 rate in the second quarter of 2017 was 27.8%. The rate was lower than the 29.8% experienced
 during the second quarter of last year, primarily due to lower state income taxes and a change

 We expect our cash flow from operations in 2017 to be approximately $375 million, which
 which is lower than the 447 million generated in 2016.
 We expect higher earnings in 2017,
 but also larger outlays for working capital
 due to the higher than anticipated cash flows
 in the fourth quarter of 2016.
 over the two-year period from 2016 to 2017,
 we expect to generate operating cash of approximately $825 million, which compares with $612 million

 Our 2017 capital spending plans of approximately $100 million include $45 million related to

 Total cost for the facility, which is expected to begin production in the second quarter of 2018, will be about $65 million.
 After this expansion, we expect capital spending in 2018 and beyond to be at levels equal to

 Our depreciation at this expense is expected to be approximately $70 million in 2017.

 Thank you.
 John, you know, the, I will tell you, our steel prices have increased every quarter
 this year and clearly compared to the prior years, they're up significantly from the prior
 here.
 So, when we tear apart, for example, North America, second quarter, the pricing could
 and not offset the steel increases last year.
 I mean, the price increase last year did not offset the steel increases in the second quarter.
 However, as we talked about in our script,
 commercial water eaters was extremely strong for us in the quarter, as was commercial boilers.
 So those were the contributors on why we had a net positive for the quarter.
 So, I don't know if that answers it's got or not, but we've had continual increase and
 I'm still up.
 Well, I'll take that.
 Well, we put it in, there was anticipation that's field prices and we talked about it
 on the year-end call that we thought steel prices would
 level off and maybe decline, we haven't seen that at all, and they've continued to increase.
 So, you know, I think that's part of the factor on why we're seeing what we're seeing is
 They continue to increase higher than what?
 Right.
 Well, I'd say they weren't talked about because they were flat to the year prior year, and
 You saw that, certainly, in the April and May data, and I'll tell you what we've seen
 it's on June, it was the same.
 So it was very flat with the prior year.
 And then when you look, that's down a couple 100,000 units
 from the first quarter.
 but I'll tell you overall, we're pleased
 where the industry is.
 It's about almost $200,000 when you include tank lists.
 You're over here.
 All right, let's go.
 and
 Well, obviously it depends where steel goes, but we would expect it will offset.

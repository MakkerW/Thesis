1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
things. Nick. Thanks, Inga, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 7 with a recap

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:15,120
of our first quarter sales performance. As Inga mentioned, we posted strong organic growth in

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:26,140
the quarter of 4.6%, with volumes up 4.5% and selling prices up 0.1%. Divestitures of non-strategic

4
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,460
businesses, reduced sales by 0.4 percentage points, and foreign currency translation decreased sales

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:42,300
by another 50 basis points. As a result, total first quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.7%

6
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,660
versus last year. As you can see on the right side of the slide, growth was broad-based across

7
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,780
all geographic areas. Let me start with the U.S., where organic growth was 1.4%,

8
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:04,500
led by mid-single-digit increases in both industrial and safety and graphics. Our electronics and energy

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,900
and healthcare businesses also delivered solid growth in the quarter. The consumer business

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:18,180
declined mid-single digits organically in Q1, impacted by channel adjustments in the office market,

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:25,140
as Inga mentioned. Asia-Pacific led the company with organic growth of 10.1%.

12
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,300
All business groups posted strong growth in the quarter, led by a double-digit increase in

13
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,680
electronics and energy. We also had strong growth in industrial, healthcare, and consumer.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,400
Looking at key countries within Asia-Pacific, organic growth increased 13% in both China, Hong Kong,

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:55,300
and Japan. Excluding our electronics businesses, China-Hong Kong grew 12%, and Japan was up 2%.

16
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:05,180
Moving to EMEA, organic growth increased 4% in Q1. West Europe was up 5% organically,

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:12,560
with sales growth led by industrial and safety and graphics. Central East Europe and Middle East Africa

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:22,680
grew nearly 2%. Finally, organic growth in Latin America-Canada increased 2.3%, led by a high single-digit

19
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,680
growth in healthcare, along with solid growth in consumer and safety and graphics. At a country level,

20
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:39,560
Mexico continued to deliver strong growth at 8%. Canada was up 3%, while Brazil declined 3%.

21
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:47,580
Please turn to slide 8 for the first quarter P&L highlights. Company-wide, first quarter sales

22
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:59,540
were $7.7 billion, and net income increased 3.7% to $1.3 billion. GAP operating margins were 23.1%,

23
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:08,840
down 100 basis points versus last year's Q1. Earlier, you heard Inga mention the additional $136 million

24
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:16,440
of strategic investments we made in Q1 to strengthen 3M for the future, in terms of both growth and

25
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,000
productivity. Excluding the impact of these investments, margins were up 80 basis points

26
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,300
year over year, driven by strong organic growth and solid operational performance.

27
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,480
Let's take a closer look at the various components of our margin performance in the first quarter.

28
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,440
Organic growth, along with improved productivity, contributed 120 basis points to margins.

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,980
Lower raw material costs, net of selling price changes, added another 50 basis points.

30
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,760
Raw material prices remained favorable to start the year, as our global businesses again delivered

31
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,560
savings in excess of market price changes.

32
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,860
We expect raw material benefits to moderate as the year progresses, but still remain positive

33
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,120
for the full year.

34
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,760
Turning to headwinds, foreign currency, net of hedge gains, brought margins down 40 basis points

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,360
in the quarter.

36
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:24,140
As previously discussed, strategic investments impacted margins by 180 basis points, and higher pension

37
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,660
and OPEB expense decreased margins by 30 basis points year-on-year.

38
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:36,460
Finally, lower year-on-year gains from divestitures reduced margins by an additional 20 basis points.

39
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,400
Let's now turn to slide 9 for a closer look at earnings per share.

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,020
First quarter, gap earnings increased 5.4% to $2.16 per share.

41
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:58,420
The combination of organic growth and productivity contributed $0.22 per share to Q1 earnings.

42
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,680
Business transformation is having a positive impact on our productivity efforts.

43
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,500
The year-on-year impact from divestitures reduced earnings by $0.03 per share.

44
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,840
Foreign currency, net of hedging, reduced pre-tax earnings by $0.04 a share, while strategic investments

45
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,440
were a $0.16 impact.

46
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:28,100
The first quarter tax rate was 23.7% versus 26.8% in the comparable quarter,

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,260
which increased earnings by $0.09 per share.

48
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,040
The lower year-on-year tax rate was driven by favorable geographic profit mix,

49
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,540
increased tax benefits from employee equity-based compensation,

50
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,600
and ongoing strategic tax initiatives.

51
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:55,080
In light of the first quarter performance, we now expect our 2017 full-year tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27.5%.

52
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:02,740
Finally, average diluted shares outstanding declined nearly 2% year-on-year,

53
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,020
which added $0.03 to Q1 earnings per share.

54
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,260
Please turn to slide 10 for a look at cash flow.

55
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,800
We continue to generate solid operating cash flow as a company,

56
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,980
which allows us to consistently invest in the business and also return cash back to shareholders.

57
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:30,180
First quarter free cash flow was $701 million, down $245 million year-on-year,

58
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,660
largely due to the timing of pension contributions.

59
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:42,000
Full-year 2017 pension contributions are expected to remain in the range of $300 to $500 million,

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,140
similar to 2016.

61
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,460
Free cash flow conversion was 53%, and for the full year,

62
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,460
we continue to anticipate free cash flow conversion to be in the range of 95% to 105%.

63
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,680
Recall that Q1 is typically our lowest conversion rate of the year.

64
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
First quarter capital expenditures were $287 million,

65
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,560
in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.

66
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,360
For the full year, we continue to anticipate CapEx investments in the range of $1.3 to $1.5 billion.

67
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,320
As you heard earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 6%,

68
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,740
resulting in $702 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders during the quarter.

69
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:38,220
We also returned $690 million to shareholders through gross share repurchases.

70
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:44,840
We continue to expect full-year repurchases in the range of $2.5 to $4.5 billion.

71
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,340
Let's now review our performance by business group, starting with Industrial on slide 11.

72
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,860
Industrial continued its strong growth momentum from Q4,

73
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,640
delivering first quarter sales of $2.7 billion, up 5.7% organically.

74
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,620
Industrial's growth was broad-based across all businesses and geographic areas.

75
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,860
Our automotive OEM business continued to lead sales growth within Industrial,

76
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,720
increasing double digits organically.

77
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,900
Growth in this business outpaced the rate of global car and light truck builds by more than 400 basis points.

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,360
Advanced materials also had a strong start to the year, up high single digits.

79
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,540
Our heartlanded businesses within Industrial, abrasives, industrial adhesives and tapes,

80
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,640
and automotive aftermarket, each increased mid-single digits organically.

81
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:52,240
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by Asia-Pacific, up high single digits,

82
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,540
while the U.S. and EMEA increased mid-single digits.

83
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,180
Industrial delivered first quarter operating income of $625 million,

84
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,640
with operating margins of 23.1%.

85
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,360
Operating margins were down 80 basis points year-on-year,

86
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,640
or up 40 basis points, adjusting for a Q1 2016 divestiture gain.

87
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,820
As you can see, Industrial is off to a strong start to 2017.

88
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,280
For the full year, we now expect organic growth in the range of 2% to 5%,

89
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,360
versus our prior estimate of 1% to 3%.

90
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,660
Please turn to slide 12.

91
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:42,720
First quarter sales and safety and graphics were up 4.8% organically, to $1.5 billion.

92
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,820
Personal safety, another heartland business,

93
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,560
delivered strong organic growth in the high single digits,

94
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,300
with particular strength in Asia-Pacific and the U.S.

95
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,320
The Rook and Granules business continued to perform well in the first quarter,

96
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,680
posting double-digit organic growth as demand remained strong in the replacement shingle market.

97
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Geographically, safety and graphics grew organically in all areas,

98
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,900
led by mid-single-digit increases in EMEA, Asia-Pacific, and the U.S.

99
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,160
Operating income for the business group was $399 million,

100
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,960
and operating margins increased 180 basis points to 26.1%.

101
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,020
Adjusting for acquisition and divestiture activity in this year and last,

102
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,960
operating margins were up 80 basis points.

103
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,840
As with Industrial, safety and graphics is off to a strong start,

104
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,500
and growth is better than we anticipated entering the year.

105
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
We now expect organic growth for this business to be between 2% and 5%,

106
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,740
versus a prior estimate of 1% to 3%.

107
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,140
Please turn to slide 13.

108
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,140
Our healthcare business generated first-quarter sales of $1.4 billion.

109
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,520
Organic growth was 3.1% year-on-year,

110
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,960
in line with our full-year expectations of 3% to 5%.

111
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Growth was led by a double-digit increase in both drug delivery systems and food safety.

112
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,020
Our medical consumables businesses,

113
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,020
which represent the largest segment within healthcare,

114
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,160
posted good growth in Q1.

115
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,660
Oral care delivered mid-single-digit organic growth in the first quarter,

116
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,060
a marked improvement from the second half of 2016.

117
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,720
Our health information systems business was down low single digits organically.

118
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,060
We expect the business to improve throughout the year.

119
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,100
Geographically, organic growth in healthcare was positive in all areas,

120
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,080
led by high single-digit growth in Latin America, Canada, and Asia Pacific.

121
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,500
We saw notable strength in China-Hong Kong,

122
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,640
which was up double digits in the quarter.

123
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,540
Healthcare's operating income was $434 million,

124
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,620
and margins remained strong at 30.5%.

125
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,920
Importantly, we generated these returns

126
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,380
while investing an additional $21 million

127
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,800
to enhance growth in core platforms across the business.

128
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,100
Please turn to slide 14.

129
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,660
Electronics and energy led our company

130
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,340
with organic growth of 11.5% in the first quarter.

131
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,760
Sales were $1.2 billion.

132
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,840
The electronic side of the business grew 18% organically,

133
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:43,260
as our team successfully drove increased penetration

134
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,500
on a number of OEM platforms.

135
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,120
Demand strengthened across most market segments

136
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,380
in consumer electronics,

137
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,160
which also boosted our growth rate,

138
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,500
and we benefited from favorable year-on-year comps.

139
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,120
Our energy-related businesses were up 1% organically,

140
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
with low single-digit growth in electrical markets,

141
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,480
while telecom was flat.

142
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,820
On a geographic basis,

143
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,360
organic growth was up double digits in Asia Pacific,

144
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,140
where our electronics business is concentrated.

145
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,540
First quarter operating income for electronics and energy

146
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,240
was $225 million,

147
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,620
with margins of 18.6%,

148
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,520
up 70 basis points.

149
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,340
Adjusting for first quarter portfolio actions,

150
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,800
margins were nearly 24%,

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,400
up 600 basis points year-on-year.

152
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,300
As you can see,

153
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,900
Q1 organic growth was very robust

154
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,360
for electronics and energy.

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,720
As a result,

156
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,940
we are updating our full-year growth expectations

157
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,060
for this business

158
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,220
to a range of up 1% to 6%,

159
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,480
versus a prior range of down 3% to up 1%.

160
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
The first half of the year

161
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,120
is expected to be stronger than the second half,

162
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,900
largely driven by year-on-year comps.

163
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,580
Please turn to slide 15.

164
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,180
First quarter sales and consumer were $1 billion,

165
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,340
and organic growth declined 1.2% year-on-year.

166
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,680
Three of our four businesses within consumer

167
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,900
grew organically,

168
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,100
again led by home improvement,

169
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,900
followed by consumer health care and home care.

170
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,840
Within the home improvement business,

171
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,760
our command damage-free mounting products

172
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,940
posted strong double-digit growth

173
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,220
as accelerated investments continued to pay off.

174
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,220
Filtrete filters also delivered strong growth in the quarter.

175
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,220
More than offsetting this growth

176
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,820
was a year-on-year decline

177
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,560
in our stationary and office supplies business,

178
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,720
which was impacted by continued channel inventory reductions,

179
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,760
primarily in the U.S. office retail and wholesale.

180
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
Geographically,

181
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,800
organic growth in consumer

182
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,920
was led by Asia Pacific and Latin America Canada,

183
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,000
which was more than offset by a decline in the U.S.

184
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,080
Operating income was $222 million,

185
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,720
with operating margins of 21.3%.

186
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,580
Looking at the full year,

187
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,440
we expect organic growth for consumer

188
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,860
to be in the range of 1% to 3%

189
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,340
versus a prior estimate of 2% to 4%.

190
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,220
We also expect to see growth improve

191
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,400
as the year progresses.

192
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,180
Please turn to slide 16.

193
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,620
Before I turn it back to Inga,

194
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,700
let me address a few items

195
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,180
that we anticipate will happen

196
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,960
over the remainder of 2017.

197
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,800
The net impact of these items

198
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,400
is factored into our EPS guidance today.

199
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,000
First, as you may recall,

200
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,720
in December,

201
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,340
we announced the divestiture

202
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,540
of our identity management business

203
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,120
within Safety and Graphics.

204
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,520
The sale of this business,

205
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,440
which has annual sales

206
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,380
of approximately $205 million,

207
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,680
is expected to close

208
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
during the second quarter.

209
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,980
Upon completion,

210
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,420
we expect to record a gain

211
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,600
on sale of approximately $0.55 per share,

212
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,180
partially offset by the profit

213
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,440
that will go with the business in 2017

214
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,980
after the divestiture is closed.

215
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,580
In addition,

216
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,120
recall at our investor meeting

217
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,580
in March of 2016,

218
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,840
we introduced a plan

219
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,860
to better optimize our portfolio

220
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,560
and supply chain footprint.

221
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,780
We expect to make significant progress

222
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,520
on that plan in 2017

223
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,000
with associated costs

224
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,980
in the range of $0.40 to $0.45 per share

225
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,960
over the remainder of the year.

226
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,740
We anticipate $0.20 to $0.30 per share

227
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,680
will incur in Q2.

228
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,580
In total,

229
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,760
the net impact of these items

230
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,120
is expected to add

231
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,620
between $0.05 and $0.10

232
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,140
to 2017 earnings per share.

233
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,060
Again,

234
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,160
this impact is reflected

235
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,500
in our full year updated guidance,

236
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,360
which Inga will now cover

237
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,540
on slide 17.

238
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,000
Inga?

239
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,180
To acknowledge your request.

240
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,300
Yeah, Andy,

241
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,240
thanks for the question.

242
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,120
You covered quite a few things there.

243
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,120
Just from an overall theme standpoint,

244
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:18,660
Andy,

245
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,740
we're always looking for opportunities

246
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,560
to enhance the value of the enterprise,

247
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,640
and that's really part

248
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
of our business model.

249
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,320
What you see in the first quarter

250
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,900
for incremental investments,

251
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,460
some of that was investments

252
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,600
we were taking to accelerate growth,

253
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
and that was really lined up

254
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,820
with what we had shared last December

255
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,120
of the incremental $100 million

256
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,040
over the course of 2017

257
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,060
to deliver accelerated growth

258
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,620
throughout the year.

259
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,440
The other context I'd share with you

260
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,060
in thinking about this step-up

261
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,020
in strategic investments.

262
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,600
If you think back to last March

263
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,720
at our investor meeting

264
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,780
when we laid out

265
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,540
our five-year plan,

266
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,640
we shared plans

267
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,340
for optimizing our portfolio

268
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,620
and supply chain footprint

269
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,440
with, at that time,

270
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,280
what we described,

271
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,060
a total of between

272
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,920
$500 and $600 million

273
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,420
of investments,

274
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,900
and ultimately

275
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,560
that we expected that

276
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,440
by 2020

277
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,300
to be creating

278
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,500
$125 to $175 million

279
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,180
of annualized benefit,

280
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,740
operating income benefit.

281
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,320
What you're seeing

282
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,340
in this step-up

283
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,440
of accelerated strategic investments,

284
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,820
both for the quarter

285
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,220
and for the year,

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,240
is us taking more action

287
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,220
related to that,

288
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,780
what we laid out last year

289
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,720
for the optimized actions

290
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,360
on our supply chain footprint.

291
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,560
Yeah, Joe,

292
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,780
as the quarter went on,

293
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,040
it was consistent strength

294
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
across the quarter,

295
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,340
all three months

296
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,940
of the quarter.

297
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,860
And I'd further add,

298
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,940
we're seeing April,

299
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,020
the start of April,

300
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,240
tracking very much in line

301
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,400
with what we've been seeing

302
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,700
for the first quarter.

303
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,900
So, really no

304
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,260
inter-quarter

305
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,980
trend changes.

306
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,920
Yeah, Julian,

307
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,980
we're not fundamentally

308
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,120
seeing any change

309
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,200
in our pricing power.

310
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,660
That remains strong.

311
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
We do continue

312
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,900
to look for targeted places

313
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,660
where we can

314
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,320
use price

315
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,160
to help drive

316
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,520
organic volume growth.

317
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,160
If I look out

318
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
over total 2017,

319
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,720
we're still,

320
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,300
we're expecting

321
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,860
U.S. price growth

322
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,340
to be approximately flat.

323
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,580
If I expand it

324
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,720
to the total globe,

325
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,480
if I pull out

326
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,380
the FX impact,

327
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,400
we expect pricing

328
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
to be up slightly.

329
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,260
Our normal range

330
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,080
is 30 to 50 basis points

331
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,160
of core price growth.

332
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,540
I think it'll be

333
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,680
somewhere between there

334
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,400
and flat

335
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,900
for total 2017.

336
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,380
Yeah,

337
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,660
the $136 million

338
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,920
in strategic investments

339
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
in the first quarter,

340
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,400
Julian,

341
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,280
a little less

342
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,260
than half of that

343
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,340
is investments

344
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,120
that we see

345
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,680
having a fairly

346
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,920
short-term return

347
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,340
in 2017

348
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:16,840
and then

349
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,160
into early 2018.

350
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,100
And those are

351
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,720
primarily growth-oriented

352
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,640
investments

353
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,660
and those growth-oriented

354
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,400
investments

355
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,080
were factored

356
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,900
into the guidance

357
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,520
we set out

358
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,440
for the year.

359
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,660
The remainder

360
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,800
of the strategic investments,

361
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,180
those relate

362
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
to our portfolio,

363
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,740
supply chain footprint,

364
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:37,960
and that's really

365
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,860
laid out,

366
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,120
aligned closely

367
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,760
with the plan

368
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,820
that we put forward.

369
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,480
Yeah,

370
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,100
so when we,

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,280
in December

372
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,080
when we laid out

373
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,080
our guidance,

374
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,340
EPS guidance

375
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,060
for the year,

376
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,660
strategic investments

377
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,300
we had

378
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,760
incrementally

379
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,780
in a 5 to 10 cent range.

380
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,340
that was aligned

381
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,180
primarily

382
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,360
or almost exclusively

383
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,220
with our

384
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,700
growth investments.

385
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,660
Now what you're seeing,

386
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,180
we're seeing the growth

387
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,200
investments play out

388
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,580
exactly as we guided,

389
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
still in that 5 to 10 cent range

390
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,660
for the total year.

391
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,000
What we're layering

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,100
on top of that

393
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,760
is additional footprint

394
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,880
actions that were,

395
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,400
and portfolio actions

396
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,020
that were taken

397
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,140
throughout 2017.

398
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,480
So on top

399
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,560
of the growth investments,

400
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,160
there's roughly

401
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,020
an incremental

402
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,760
10 cents

403
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
of supply chain

404
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,300
and portfolio actions

405
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:29,940
that we took

406
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,340
in the first quarter

407
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,480
of 2017.

408
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,020
And then in terms

409
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,800
of the guidance

410
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,820
for the bounce

411
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,640
of this year,

412
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,380
for Q2,

413
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:38,780
3,

414
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,200
and 4,

415
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,020
there's an extra

416
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,200
40 to 45 cents

417
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,180
on top of that

418
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,400
that was not part

419
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,720
of our initial guidance.

420
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,320
So all in,

421
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,980
the growth investments,

422
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,920
the incremental

423
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,520
10 that we took

424
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,400
in the first quarter

425
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,600
plus what we're expecting

426
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,780
Q2 through Q4,

427
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,160
it's now in the range

428
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,400
of 55 to 65 cents

429
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,240
for the total year.

430
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:01,760
Nigel,

431
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,440
we're always,

432
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,620
as I said earlier,

433
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,420
we're always looking

434
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,400
for opportunities.

435
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,740
The level

436
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,820
that we were investing

437
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,560
in Q1

438
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,760
in strategic investments

439
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,580
around growth,

440
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,200
no pull forward there.

441
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,960
That's coming

442
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,560
exactly as we had planned.

443
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,320
The increased

444
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,560
strategic investments

445
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,120
around portfolio actions

446
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,880
and supply chain footprint,

447
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,040
that's aligned

448
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,560
with our longer term vision.

449
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,220
The exact timing

450
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,900
of when we were

451
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,920
going to do that,

452
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,200
we did not have clarity

453
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,800
on until we started

454
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,580
pulling the trigger

455
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,760
on some of those actions

456
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,700
in the first quarter

457
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,280
and some that we expect

458
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,000
to have happen

459
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,200
over the next three quarters.

460
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,600
So I'm not sure

461
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,700
I'd characterize it

462
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,880
as a pull forward

463
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,800
as much as it would be.

464
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,780
Now is the time

465
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,780
that it looked like

466
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,380
the right time

467
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,180
for us to pull

468
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,720
the trigger on actions

469
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,160
that we had laid out

470
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,960
last March.

471
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,340
No,

472
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
the 40 to 45 cents

473
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,620
does not include

474
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,900
anything for Scott Safety.

475
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:01,920
At the time

476
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,380
that closes,

477
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,920
we will update guidance

478
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,040
to take into account

479
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,780
any impact

480
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,440
that we'll have

481
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,860
on our 2017 earnings.

482
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,640
In our industrial channel,

483
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
we are seeing

484
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,400
increased confidence

485
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,920
in the channel,

486
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,040
which we are seeing,

487
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,300
while we're seeing

488
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,600
good sellouts

489
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,200
of our product,

490
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:22,680
we're seeing

491
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,260
even stronger sell

492
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,040
into the industrial channel,

493
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,440
primarily in the U.S.

494
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,980
So that is one place

495
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,000
where we're attributing

496
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,180
it to higher confidence

497
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,280
amongst that channel

498
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,620
and seeing what appears

499
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,820
to be some restocking

500
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,120
of depleted channel levels

501
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,660
that we've seen

502
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,280
in the past.

503
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,380
Jeff,

504
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,580
to your first question

505
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,560
on the tax rate

506
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,520
for what we're now seeing

507
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,160
for total 2017,

508
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,400
there's a few dynamics

509
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,980
going on.

510
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,900
First of all,

511
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
we are seeing

512
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,220
a favorable

513
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,480
geographic profit mix

514
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,040
for us

515
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,480
that is helping us

516
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,620
in our tax rate.

517
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,560
It's been a headwind

518
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,460
for us the last

519
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,660
couple of years,

520
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,660
and that's switching over

521
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,480
to a tailwind

522
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,440
for us this year.

523
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,760
We're also seeing

524
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,720
some of the benefits

525
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,740
as you'd expect

526
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,860
from some of our

527
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,040
tax planning,

528
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,700
but one of the more

529
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,640
significant items

530
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,960
just in the first quarter

531
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,220
is the benefit

532
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,760
we're getting

533
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,920
from the accounting

534
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,200
standard change

535
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,580
that came into effect

536
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,400
last year

537
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,260
for the excess tax benefits

538
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,300
from stock-based compensation.

539
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,480
from a year-on-year basis,

540
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,060
that's about

541
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,760
a four-cent benefit

542
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,900
versus what we had

543
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,180
a year ago.

544
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,420
And,

545
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,280
Jeff,

546
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,980
I'd say that's

547
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,720
the wild card.

548
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,400
Other things

549
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:43,940
are going

550
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,980
very much

551
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,960
as we had planned

552
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,700
to get to the

553
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,320
27% tax rate

554
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,780
by 2020,

555
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
but with the

556
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,500
added variability

557
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,540
from what happens

558
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,640
with this excess

559
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,860
tax benefit

560
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,680
from stock-based

561
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,400
compensation,

562
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,320
there'll be

563
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,920
some quarters

564
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,080
that's a benefit

565
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,820
and some quarters

566
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,380
we won't see

567
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,460
any benefit at all.

568
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:05,840
All in,

569
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,400
we're well on track

570
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,340
for hitting

571
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,500
the 27%

572
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,680
in 2020,

573
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,180
possibly even

574
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,000
lower than that,

575
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,260
but when we have

576
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,000
better clarity

577
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,480
on that,

578
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,960
we'll give a revised

579
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,780
number of

580
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,760
can that go

581
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,340
even lower

582
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,400
than the 27%.

583
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,000
To the

584
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,140
second point

585
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,560
on the

586
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,160
strategic

587
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,100
investments,

588
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,680
the $136 million,

589
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,060
of the growth-related

590
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,880
investments,

591
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,060
you're correct,

592
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:35,720
health care

593
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,340
had the

594
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,200
majority

595
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,480
of that.

596
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,180
There were

597
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,200
small amounts,

598
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,300
single digits

599
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,860
of millions

600
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,460
of dollars,

601
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,540
low to

602
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,640
mid-single digits

603
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,140
and millions

604
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:46,560
of dollars

605
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,080
in the other

606
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,780
four business

607
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,160
groups,

608
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,200
and then

609
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,740
from a

610
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,800
portfolio

611
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,560
and supply

612
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,320
chain footprint

613
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,200
optimization,

614
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,660
the vast

615
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,440
majority of

616
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,820
that is

617
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,420
impacting

618
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,300
the

619
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,520
electronics

620
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,080
and energy

621
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,640
business

622
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,660
with a little

623
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,180
of that

624
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,000
hitting the

625
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,520
consumer

626
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,020
and office

627
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:05,540
business,

628
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,680
the consumer

629
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,380
business group.

630
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:08,980
Yeah,

631
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,540
Rob,

632
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:09,920
we,

633
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,200
as far as

634
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,040
the automation

635
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,100
portion of our

636
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,980
CapEx spending,

637
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,140
a year ago

638
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:16,920
at our investor

639
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,280
meeting,

640
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:17,880
we laid out

641
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,160
that we

642
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,840
expected that

643
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,160
to be

644
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,800
a noticeable

645
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,760
part of our

646
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,780
CapEx investments.

647
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,300
What we're

648
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:23,960
seeing is

649
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,660
that's playing

650
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:25,400
out exactly

651
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,360
as we laid

652
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,840
out a year

653
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,140
ago,

654
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,100
that we're

655
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,360
seeing

656
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:28,920
continued

657
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,660
opportunities

658
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,420
for automation

659
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,020
investments

660
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,640
within our

661
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,140
CapEx plans,

662
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,480
and I

663
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:36,940
wouldn't call

664
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,240
it an

665
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,780
uptick,

666
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,340
but I'd

667
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,660
say it's

668
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:39,660
playing out

669
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,380
exactly as

670
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:40,940
we laid

671
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,220
out.

672
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,720
Supply

673
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,480
chain and

674
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,100
portfolio

675
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,160
optimization,

676
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,520
and much

677
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,160
less around

678
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,720
growth.

679
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,440
If we

680
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,100
see growth

681
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,000
even higher

682
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,840
than what

683
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,660
we're currently

684
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,300
expecting,

685
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,280
could our

686
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:56,620
growth

687
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,280
investments

688
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,780
tick up

689
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,160
some?

690
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,100
I think

691
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,280
the short

692
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:00,800
answer is

693
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,040
yes,

694
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,440
it could

695
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,080
tick up

696
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:02,540
some,

697
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,240
but I

698
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,700
don't think

699
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,320
on a

700
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,760
material

701
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,400
basis.

702
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,200
I think

703
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,520
we're now

704
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:06,960
talking

705
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,380
single digits

706
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:09,940
of pennies

707
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,280
at that

708
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:10,520
point.

709
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:10,900
thanks,

710
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,140
Steve.

711
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,040
Yeah,

712
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:13,340
Steve,

713
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,140
thanks for

714
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,700
the question.

715
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,600
Part of

716
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,020
what we

717
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,680
talked about

718
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,260
a little

719
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:18,720
over a

720
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,320
year ago

721
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,540
at our

722
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,080
outlook

723
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,840
meeting for

724
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,600
the five-year

725
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:23,900
outlook

726
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,360
meeting is

727
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,380
the number

728
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,500
of manufacturing

729
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,180
sites we

730
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,680
have around

731
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,320
the world

732
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,940
and looking

733
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,600
at the

734
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
productivity

735
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,360
in those

736
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,860
sites and

737
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,580
the opportunity

738
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,340
we have

739
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,260
through

740
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,880
rationalizing

741
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,400
the number

742
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,900
of those

743
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,340
sites,

744
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,540
increasing

745
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,460
capital into

746
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,000
some of

747
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,620
our more

748
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,060
productive

749
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,580
sites,

750
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,140
the opportunity

751
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,040
to reduce

752
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,640
the total

753
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,720
footprint of

754
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,580
our manufacturing

755
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,260
and supply

756
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,780
chain

757
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,820
sites over

758
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,300
the course

759
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,800
of the next

760
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,480
four years.

761
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,580
So that's

762
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,080
what we mean

763
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,660
when we talk

764
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,060
about it

765
00:27:59,060 --> 00:27:59,340
when we

766
00:27:59,340 --> 00:27:59,760
laid out

767
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,000
a $500

768
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,600
to $600

769
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,940
million investment

770
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,400
that we

771
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,000
expect to

772
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,320
take.

773
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,380
The resulting

774
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,160
productivity

775
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,920
from that

776
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,600
that by

777
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:07,940
the time

778
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,240
we get

779
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,880
to 2020

780
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,360
we think

781
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:09,700
that will

782
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,740
add another

783
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,820
$125 to

784
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,680
$175

785
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,780
million of

786
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,080
added operating

787
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,760
income to

788
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,180
that productivity

789
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,080
we can get

790
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,440
through.

791
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,440
Look at this

792
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,080
globally,

793
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,660
Steve.

794
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,560
We had a

795
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,340
positive,

796
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,040
though very

797
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,040
small price

798
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,720
in all

799
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,280
businesses

800
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:27,960
except for

801
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,320
healthcare

802
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:28,840
where we

803
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,360
were flat.

804
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,440
To the

805
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,160
first question

806
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,960
on business,

807
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,120
and I'll go

808
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,660
further in

809
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,240
geography,

810
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,940
we expect

811
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,820
that this

812
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,500
action that

813
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:39,980
we're taking

814
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,300
in the

815
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,000
second quarter

816
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,580
and in

817
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:41,920
the third

818
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,320
and fourth

819
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,740
quarter

820
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,020
will impact

821
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,660
all businesses

822
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,300
and all

823
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,100
geographies,

824
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,100
that it will

825
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,740
be broad.

826
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,600
As far as

827
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,300
the specific

828
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,400
details of

829
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
each business,

830
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,060
we're still

831
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:57,620
working through

832
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,320
those details.

833
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,740
We're not

834
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,840
ready to be

835
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,440
sharing that

836
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:00,800
yet,

837
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,780
Lawrence.

838
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,040
And then

839
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,060
as far as

840
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,820
the 17

841
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,740
to 18,

842
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:07,760
some of

843
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,380
these actions

844
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:08,860
will have

845
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,420
a tail

846
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,460
into 18

847
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,960
where there

848
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,480
will be

849
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,720
residual cost

850
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,320
impact

851
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,580
hitting us

852
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,120
in 18,

853
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:15,980
though I

854
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,080
expect it

855
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,280
will not,

856
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
I very much

857
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:20,180
expect it

858
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:20,640
will be a

859
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,400
decline from

860
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,860
the level

861
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,620
that we're

862
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,400
projecting now

863
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,280
for 2017.

864
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:24,420
you.

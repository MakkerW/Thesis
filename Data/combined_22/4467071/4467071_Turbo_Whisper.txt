 I could not be more proud of our exceptional third quarter performance, making our fourth
 performance.

 We also strengthen our commercial foothold in attractive markets throughout the country

 We are extremely confident in our ability to achieve our growth objectives while maintaining our industry-leading margins.
 We have a highly efficient, vertically integrated, and low-cost operation
 with an extensive portfolio of innovative
 top-of-the-line products that should allow us to continue winning in our market.
 I will now turn the call over to Chris to provide additional details on our record backlog.
 Thank you, Jose Manuel.
 The strength of our results reflects our ability to execute our growth strategy as a U.S.-centric
 company.
 while providing exceptional service to our customers.
 We were thrilled to build on top of our first half 2021 momentum.
 On the third quarter, we gained share, delivered new products offering, and expanded our dealer network.
 During the quarter, we were pleased to begin invoicing products under our new Multimax
 product line, which target
 production, home builders, as well as legacy and new dealers.
 This is an opportunity that we believe represents significant upside to our long-term growth
 Beyond new products, you can see a lot of potential.
 Beyond new products, we are seeing a sharp acceleration of growth in our
 prestige and elite single-family residential product lines.
 We continue to expect strong growth in single-family to respect a shared gain held by a
 community.
 positive overall housing environment in the U.S.
 In addition, we have a number of commitments for commercial and multifamily projects, which
 help to grow our
 backlogged to a new record level of $575.8 million at quarter-end.
 As it relates to commercial indicators, we have been pleased to see increases in the
 ABI index, which moved further into expansion territory for the eighth consecutive month
 in September.
 The September ABI index increased to 56.6 compared to 55.6 in August, remaining in expansion
 territory and consistent with levels not seen since the early 2019. At $575.8 million, our third
 quarter backlog level represents more than 1.2 times our trailing 12-month revenue, providing
 us with solid visibility on commercial demand through 2022.
 The U.S. continues to represent an increasing share of projects, accounting for over 86%
 of our third quarter backlog.
 two-thirds of our backlog is comprised of medium- and high-rise residential projects
 as well as single-family residential already in production, while one-third is related
 to a wide array
 of commercial projects.
 As a reminder, our single-family residential growth trajectory is not fully captured in
 our backlog.
 This is due to the shorter-term spot duration of those projects.

 During the third quarter, we spent $10 million in growth CAPEX to automate a third-class

 become operational by the fourth quarter of 2021 or early in the first quarter of 2022,
 issue, we expect to have the necessary install capacity to significantly expand our invoicing
 capabilities well beyond current levels.
 I will now turn the call over to Santiago on slide 6
 to discuss the strong demand for single-family products, vertically integrated strategy,
 financial results and our improved outlook for the year.
 Thank you, Christian.
 Our third quarter results represent yet another quarter of consistent execution following years
 of investments in technology enhancements at our facilities, as well as our strategic
 positioning in the U.S. single-family residential market. In the third quarter, we were thrilled to
 expand upon our
 exceptional first half
 2021 performance
 We saw our momentum continue primarily through share gains
 and new business wins in our single-family business.
 This momentum resulted in our total revenue increasing to new record levels.
 Notably, our single-family revenues increased 213% year-over-year, representing 48% of our
 third quarter U.S. revenues
 and 35% of our U.S. sales on an LTM basis.
 reflecting new business wins and market share gains.
 Our sales continue to benefit from our vertically integrated business model
 and strategically located operations.
 The accelerating demand for our products is attributable to our ability to supply superior quality products
 with shorter lead times at an attractive value.

 We were thrilled to begin invoicing orders for our multi-max product line, targeting production home builders.
 Regardless of our future volatility in the housing market or forward-looking indicators such as housing starts,
 We expect this product line to offer pure upside to our already strong residential sales
 as we continue to focus on expanding our single-family presence
 with dealership expansion and geographic diversification.

 We would like to draw your attention to the factors driving our success and above market
 growth in 2021, helping us to differentiate Technoglass as the architectural glass provider
 of choice in the U.S.
 As we have discussed in previous quarters, our strategically located vertically integrated
 and low-cost operations, provide us with sustainable competitive advantages compared to our peers.
 Our structural advantages and significant investments in our operations continue to
 facilitate our ability to quote
 more projects, expand
 customer relationships
 and deliver products with much shorter lead times than the current industry average.
 our very clean integration
 and joint venture with Sengoban allows us significant control
 over our purchasing and transportation costs
 with no material pressures from raw material costs
 or material availability.
 also
 we have not experienced
 any significant wage
 cost increases or labor
 constraints.
 Additionally, energy costs continue to be stable.
 our ability to source energy from our solar panel generation and natural gas cogeneration.
 Collectively, this has enhanced the ability to deliver attractively priced products in a timely manner and, in turn, unlock opportunities to build new relationships, entrench ourselves with existing customers, and drive market share gains.
 On slide number eight, we displayed the areas where we believe we have already made
 a significant difference.
 significant achievements across the ESG spectrum.
 We are pleased to further highlight our commitment to environmental, social, and governance
 responsibilities through our 2020
 Sustainability Report, published a few weeks ago.
 Throughout our year, we have a great opportunity for us, and we have a great opportunity for
 as a public company, we have
 worked to serve all of our stakeholders from implementing green technology such as our 15
 million investment
 in solar technology for our facilities to our efforts to develop Technoglass as an employer
 of choice in Colombia
 by way of our investments in our employee and corporate culture.
 On slide nine, we have provided a high-level view of the goals we will seek to achieve
 on a go-forward basis, as outlined in our report.
 We have designed and continuously implemented strategies aimed to encourage the efficient
 use of materials and resources, as well as the development of environmentally friendly
 technologies.
 We also look to responsibly manage the value chain
 and the life cycle of the products we sell.
 And we do all of this to offer our partners innovative and best-in-class products
 that are environmentally friendly and energy efficient.
 Technoglass remains dedicated to corporate social responsibility.
 And our 2020 reports marks another important milestone in our ESG journey.
 Let's now discuss our third quarter financials, starting with revenue drivers on slide number 11.
 Total revenues increased 26% year-over-year to a record $130.4 million for the third quarter.
 In the U.S., which represents 94% of our total revenues, we saw growth of approximately 29% to a record $123.2 million.
 compared to $95.7 million in the prior year quarter.
 This strength was primarily driven by strong growth in our single-family housing activities
 and market share gains that I discussed previously.

 Commercial is on track to recover as we move early into 2022.
 looking at the drivers of adjusted EBITDA on slide number 12.
 Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of 2021 increased 36.1% to a record $38.7 million,
 compared to $28.5 million in the prior year quarter.
 Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.7%.
 a third-quarter record, and a strong 220 basis points improvement compared to the prior year period.
 We were pleased to produce record third-quarter gross profit on both a dollar and margin base.
 Our gross profit is a total of $1.00 million.
 profit increased 28.7%
 to 51.6 million, representing a gross margin of 39.6%.
 This compared to gross profit of $40.1 million in the prior year quarter, representing a
 gross margin of 38.8%.
 Our 80 basis point improvement in margin was mainly attributable to greater operating efficiencies
 and a higher mix of revenue from manufacturing versus installation activity, given our increased
 maintenance.
 of single family residential products
 where we do not carry out installation.
 Higher nominal operating expenses for the quarter mainly reflected higher variable expenses
 related to marine and ground transportation and commissions.
 As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were lowered by 280 basis points compared
 to the prior year period.
 due to higher revenues and better operating leverage on personnel, professional fees, and other fixed expenses.
 Now, looking at our Balance Sheet and Leverage Profile on slide number 13.
 To reiterate a point made in previous quarters, the recapitalization of our debt structure
 last October
 and our outstanding track record of cash flow generation
 has significantly enhanced our financial flexibility.
 In the third quarter, we were proud to record operating cash flow of $33 million at an 84% conversion from adjusted EBITDA.
 Over the past 12 months, we have generated operating cash flow of $114 million, representing
 85% of adjusted EBITDA are higher margin, shorter cash cycle single-family revenues
 combined with exceptional working capital management
 and low interest expense are all helping to drive additional shareholder value.
 the transformation
 in our ability to generate significant cash.
 left us well positioned to deploy capital opportunistically during the quarter.
 To that end, we spend $10 million in growth CAPEX in the quarter in order to address
 CAPEX.
 demand.
 This move aligns with our strategy to invest in further operational efficiencies
 and allows us to prepare for the additional growth we expect in the quarters ahead.
 We expect these investments to be operational late in the fourth quarter of 2021 or early
 first quarter of 2022.
 In addition to investments in our operations, we use excess capital to voluntarily prepay
 $30 million of debt under our syndicated term loan facility during the quarter.
 We are pleased to achieve our lowest leverage ratio in the company's history, which decreased
 to 0.9 times
 net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter A. Furthermore, our joint venture with Cengovan
 to construct our previously announced second state-of-the-art float glass plant in Barranquilla
 remains on track to break ground in the first half of 2022.
 As we discussed in the past, our capital contributions toward that project have already been completed.
 So, we don't expect any additional CAPEX as it relates to the project.
 to our outlook on slide number 15.
 Based on our strong third quarter performance
 and continued momentum
 in 2021, as well as our solid demand outlook through year end, we are increasing our full
 the year 2021 outlook.
 We now expect full-year 2021 revenues of $485 million to $495 million, representing growth of 31% at the midpoint.
 We continue to expect the U.S. to represent the significant majority of our growth.
 Based on this sales outlook and anticipated mix of revenues, we're raising our full year
 adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $140 to $145 million, representing 46% growth at
 the midpoint of the range as well as margin expansion.
 Our gross margins should continue to benefit from our high-return CAPEX investments in
 automation initiatives, as well as our proven ability to efficiently manage costs.
 As a reminder, we do not carry out installation for our single-family residential sales.
 we do carry out installation for many of the commercial projects in our backlog.
 Based on our strong year-to-date mix of single-family revenues
 and our faster growth in that end market,
 we still anticipate a larger mix of higher margin product versus installation revenue for full year 2021 compared to the prior year.
 That said, given the anticipated sequential increase
 in the mix of our commercial revenues that include installation,
 we expect
 our margins to normalize to a high 30% level in the fourth quarter of 2021.
 We expect CAPEX in 2021 to be approximately $35 million with a large portion of these
 expenses going towards
 further automation and growth investments to efficiently manage increasing demand for our products.
 Maintenance CAPEX continues to represent less than 2% of our sales.
 In summary, we are extremely pleased with our exceptional performance to date in 2021
 and are happy to see strong returns
 from our business enhancements initiatives
 over the past few years.
 Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, and our very conservative leverage profile position us well
 to generate ongoing value creation for shareholders.
 Looking ahead, we will continue to leverage our unique, very clean, integrated platform
 to target new customer relationships
 to further penetrate the U.S. single-family residential market
 to our innovative products
 and superior lead times.
 We believe these key differentiators, along with our prudent growth investments, will
 continue to provide greater returns for our shareholders as we move into 2022 with that

 One moment, please, while we poll for questions.
 Thank you.
 Our first question comes from a line of Tim Wadges with Baird.
 Please proceed with your question.
 Hey, everybody.
 Good morning.
 Nice job.
 Good morning.
 maybe just
 to start on residential
 you know obviously you know clearly a lot of momentum behind that business
 business line.
 I guess at this point, what's your visibility for residential into next year?
 and I guess you just did basically $60 million in sales this quarter.
 Or do you think that's a proper kind of baseline, you know, to use moving forward?
 I mean, can we effectively annualize that?
 Yes, I believe
 that is about
 of line as a matter of fact
 we believe we're going to keep increasing
 our residential line
 and
 that
 60 million per quarter
 is in line with
 what we believe is the bottom line
 for that line of business.
 Okay.
 And when you think about the opportunity, maybe just even in Florida, could you give us some perspective how big the Florida market is on residential and kind of where, you know, your share is today?
 Oh, I believe our share is perhaps 20%.
 I don't mean it's too much, I mean,
 the competition
 there are many
 competitors and
 uh
 A couple of them are even today larger than us, so I believe there is a lot of upside that we could gain.
 Okay. Okay, that's good. And then maybe on the margin side, just on raw materials, I know you've had some favorable hedges on aluminum. How do you think of that kind of normalizing and maybe any impact there on gross margins into next year? I guess, you know, will you effectively be able to offset that with pricing? And I guess same thing with glass.
 Yeah, so basically on the glass side
 through our joint venture, we get stable pricing.
 so on the aluminum front
 is where you would have to kind of be mindful there,
 But with aluminum prices coming down, we don't foresee any impact on margins going forward.
 As we said, we see high 30s for the rest of the year, and into 2022, I don't expect that changing.
 Okay.
 Okay, great.
 Well, hop back in queue.
 Nice job, guys.
 Thanks.
 Our next question comes from the line of Josh Wilson with Raymond James.
 please proceed with your question.
 Yes, good morning.
 and thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter.
 Thanks.
 Good morning, George.
 Could you give us a sense of what the multi-max contribution was to single family in the quarter?
 Yeah, so basically right now we're doing about $2 million per month on that,
 so it's ramping up nicely.
 still a lot of the
 of the contribution was from the legacy products.
 furthermore to that
 We didn't want
 as I mentioned in the last
 cold. We don't like to
 start doing too much
 of something
 because it's a new line for us
 And we like to make our mistakes small.
 So we now have a pretty good grip on how the line works, what the customers want, how they like to receive.
 And I believe that line is going to keep increasing for next year.
 got it
 and you had some nice growth in the backlog.
 was that pretty uniform throughout the U.S.,
 or did you see pockets of strength and weakness regionally?
 Well, on the commercial side of outside of Florida, we saw a slowdown for a year and a half.
 we weren't able to close
 as many jobs as we wanted to
 because
 Cities like New York, Boston, Chicago, they lag behind everything else.
 I mean, behind Florida, for example, or behind Texas.
 but now
 in the last month
 after we
 closed the
 quarter we have seen
 I mean, a lot of
 closing jobs and
 everything is just
 building hope, and we believe
 in this quarter we're going to have
 record closings
 in those areas.
 So we see it coming up.
 We are very enthusiastic now about it.
 Good. And last one for me.
 can you give us a sense of what the 2022 CapEx might look like?
 Yeah, so it's going to be a step down.
 and obviously we invested significantly in growth
 to be able to have the operational capacity
 to grow for the next couple of years.
 my
 my guess is that we'll be around kind of 10 to 15 million type capex next
 year.
 Got it.
 Thanks so much.
 Thanks, Josh.
 Our next question comes from the line of Julio Ramiro with Sidori.
 Please proceed with your question.
 Hey, good morning.
 Thanks for taking my questions.
 Good morning, Julio.
 hey so what are you guys hearing from
 customers in Florida in regards to your
 service proposition and
 talk about how your lead times are trending
 compared to some of your competition
 in that area
 Our elite times have been steady.
 I mean, we don't have that much constraint on materials and also our capacity.
 we foresaw that
 We have a lot of demand on the product, so we expanded before the upturn.
 and we have the capacity to keep shipping at six to eight weeks.
 we're doing really good
 I mean, they're very happy
 we do
 good service
 and our windows
 they don't need that much service
 That is one of the advantages that we have.
 of.
 Okay, got it.
 And I guess for my follow-up,
 um...
 You know, your balance sheet's looking very good.
 you're under one times leverage, you invested in some growth
 and you pay down some debt in the quarter,
 or if you could just talk about, you know,
 how you think about your target leverage
 and maybe priorities for cash?
 Well, this is Christian.
 we invested
 heavily
 the last couple of years
 on
 increasing the capacity and on being more efficient doing the products, and it's paying
 off.
 That's why with the increased capacity that we're installing today, we're going to be
 able to continue to grow
 double digits
 As a Marofat
 We're going to try to be at least 20% bigger next year, better next year, and with the investment that we have,
 we have made, we have all the capacity, and obviously, we're generating good cash, and
 So the leverage is very stable and coming down here, Santiago.
 Yeah, so we're below one time, Julio.
 I think our target when we started the year was two times.
 So obviously we're very comfortable where we're at
 and have a lot of financial flexibility to undertake the growth that we're seeing.
 I think for the foreseeable future
 will continue investing in CapEx, in growth,
 And if we need to repay farther debt, that will be another way to use cash.
 But, you know, at this point, we're definitely well below our original target.
 Okay, very nice quarter and best of luck in Q4.
 Thank you.
 Our next question comes from the line of Brent Theoman with D.A. Davidson.
 Please proceed with your question.
 Hey, thank you. Congrats as well. Great quarter.
 Thanks. How are you, Brent?
 yeah thank you
 I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about 2022 or see what I can get from you guys.
 I assume that you're going to see a higher mix of installation
 as you convert
 some of this backlog, but your residential
 strength is
 unbelievable and I guess I'm trying to think about the impact to margins as the residential
 business got into a
 base that's large enough to offset that
 you know, mix and back you might see next year from installation.
 That's correct.
 And that's how we're seeing it.
 I think both factors will upset each other.
 So even if we have more installation, we think that we can maintain gross margins.
 furthermore
 On that subject, I want to clarify that we only do installation in Florida.
 we refrain from doing
 and installation
 in Texas or outside
 that we were doing before
 so
 since we're selling a lot now
 outside of Florida without installation
 even if the installation
 and wraps up
 in Florida
 with the
 increased selling outside of
 Florida without installation, and the residential picking up, and the commercial projects for
 meat size
 are, I mean, running
 unbelievably high.
 I believe
 the margins are going to stay the same
 or even better, perhaps.
 Okay.
 Yeah, and I guess I want to ask as well.
 I mean, I seem to be navigating, you know, higher logistics environment very well.
 I guess is the increase in
 unsure
 freight rates impacted your ability
 at all to penetrate more of these
 sort of inland markets, not the southeast, but maybe Midwest and elsewhere, or is that
 been negligible.
 Yo, pre-
 Freight has been coming up lately.
 we have seen
 increase like 30% of the
 or 40% in the rates, but a container takes between $40,000 to $80,000 of materials inside.
 So the freight is still a small amount, like less than 5% of 5% of cost of product and transportation.
 and we have passed
 the
 the cost over to customers.
 unfortunately we have to do it
 And we are trying to open new ways of shipping to Miami through Cartagena,
 which is a much bigger port than Barranguilla, to see if we can lower the cost of shipping.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 I guess maybe one more on Multimax.
 Just be interested in any sort of milestones and successes you've had recently with new builders.
 and any targets or objectives you guys can share for that business
 for the rest of this year, or even 22, if you're willing?
 well all the builders
 that we have been
 selling to, we have like
 six accounts
 They're all happy with the product
 The product performs much better than the competition.

 more modern style

 case
 And they are repeating and keep ordering and ordering
 and giving us
 no
 no faces what they're doing
 I mean, I see that business increasing.
 and like I said before
 we don't like to
 going to a business
 and go like crazy and then
 don't know how it works
 They make big mistakes and lose clients.
 We started, we're doing good, they're happy, we fixed a few things that they didn't like,
 and the way in which we shipped, the leave times, and the packing.
 and now they're all happy
 and we are more happy than they are.
 Okay.
 Maybe one more for me.
 It doesn't seem like you need to do M&A, but is it something you're looking at
 and what would that look like if you were?
 to us
 management and acquisitions would make sense
 and
 buying a
 company
 that we don't have the know-how
 and for now
 we have looked at many things
 and nothing is attractive enough
 for the moment
 to even mention it
 or to do anything
 in emergency
 and acquisition.
 we believe
 we can develop the market
 that grow organically
 costs a lot less
 and look at our balance sheet
 I mean, it speaks by itself.
 Well, thank you for taking the questions.
 Thanks, Brian.
 Our next question comes from a line of Alex Regal with B. Riley.
 please proceed with your question.
 Thank you, and also a great quarter here.
 coming back to the Multimax
 product and your other
 residential products, how many states are you now selling that product into, and how should we think
 about geographic growth in 2022 for that U.S.
 residential.
 Well, actually, we're now selling 99% in Florida.
 we have sold
 like I said
 the last time we were doing
 some tryouts
 in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Texas.
 and they have been
 really successful.
 people are happy
 we are learning
 and we plan to
 to step it up
 and especially from
 January
 on.
 these
 this coming

 I mean
 the quarter that we're in
 we're going to keep doing a little business
 learning the trade
 how they like to be packed
 how they like to receive
 get all the feedback
 and
 finalize the development
 of a couple of products that we were missing
 in those areas
 And for next year, we expect those as the purchasing month by month.
 And then turn it over to the U.S. commercial business, which was down in the third quarter.
 You obviously have very positive comments with regards to the backlog of that
 business and the
 reopening of that business.
 So how should we think about modeling the U.S. commercial business in 2022?
 too. I suspect it's a little bit more
 sort of back-end loaded in 2022, but your comments would be helpful.
 Well, in 2020, we expected a downturn for 2022 in the commercial outside of Florida, because Florida is booming.
 and we were expecting that
 but now
 that there are a lot of
 closings, we believe, are going to be
 par with
 this year
 and it looks
 power a little better
 in 2023
 is going to look
 a lot better than 2022 or 2021.
 You're welcome.
 Very helpful.
 Thank you very much.
 You're welcome, Al.
 Thank you.
 We have reached the end of the question and answer session.
 I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jose Manuel Diaz for further comment.
 Well, thanks, everyone, for participating on today's call.
 And we hope to keep doing our job and having a lot of good news for our shareholders.
 Thank you so much.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.
 You may disconnect your lines at this time.
 Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.
 We'll be right back.

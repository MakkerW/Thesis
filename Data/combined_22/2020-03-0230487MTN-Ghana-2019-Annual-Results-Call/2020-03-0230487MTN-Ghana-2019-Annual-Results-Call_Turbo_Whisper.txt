 Before we move on to the Q&A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call
 or pretext.
 With that, over to you, Salom.
 Thank you, Jeremiah.
 Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making time to join us on this call today.
 I will provide a brief overview of our performance for the year ending December 2019
 and speak a little bit about the outlook for this year, 2020.
 before handing over to the operator for questions and answers.
 We're excited by the strong performance delivered by MTN Ghana, the team here for the year 2019,
 in a competitive industry while maintaining market leadership
 with 55% market share.
 We grew service revenue 3% year on year, driven by strong growth in voice, data, and mobile
 Void's revenue was up in the double digits and increased by 19% year-on-year, supported
 by growth in our active subscriber base, continued improvements to our network, and
 the impact of various customer value management initiatives and pro-customer activity, which
 is very important.

 as expected
 as new lines of revenue continue to grow faster than the traditional voice business.
 Data revenue growth was strong at 33% year-on-year
 and was attributable to the higher number of active data subscribers
 and smart phone users on the network.
 as well as an increase in data usage
 across our customer base.
 data contributed 28% to total service revenue,
 up from 26% in 2018.
 Model money revenue also contributed on a strong trajectory, increasing by 28% in the
 year in which we mark its 10th anniversary in Ghana.
 Growth in mobile money was driven by the outgoing expansion in the number of active subscribers
 and increased transactional activity, as well as good growth in advanced services, as retail

 This grew by 66% with a year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion of 13 percentage points to
 51% on a reported IFRS review.
 comparing on a like for like
 IAS 17 basis, our average margin increased by 4.8 percentage point to 42.5%.
 If we further normalize for management fee, then like-for-like, even the margin expanded by 5.9 percentage points to 43.5 percent.
 The margin improvement was supported by tight controls and operating expenses, as well as distribution efficiencies.
 In terms of CAPEX, we invested 1.1 billion Ghana cities in support of the growth in the
 core business and improving the participation of quality of service to
 to our customers.
 MCN Ghana acknowledges the outbreak of coronavirus worldwide
 and its potential impact on our supply chain.
 While we monitor unfolding developments, we're exploring multiple scenarios in a bit to mitigate the impact on our business.
 On the regulatory front, the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed in May last
 into law.
 This governs the way mobile money services are conducted.
 As required of existing players such as us, we have duly applied for the new license.
 MTM Ghana maintains ongoing engagements with regulatory stakeholders with a firm focus
 of sustaining cordial relationships
 and achieving continued improvement in customer experience.

 In 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects
 in education, three in health, and one in economic empowerment.
 The board declared an interim dividend of two pesos per share after reviewing the mid-year
 performance of the company.
 After reviewing the full year performance of the company, the board shall be recommending
 in a final dividend of four Pesues per share,
 bringing the total dividend for 2019 to six Peslis per share.
 This corresponds, this represents 73% of profit after tax and a 20% increase in dividend per share.
 Before I comment briefly on Prospect Forward and the Outlook, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some changes in our management, which Jeremy had touched on a little earlier.
 as you may be aware
 from our release
 to the market last week.
 Our CFO, Muduta Kadri, and an executive director of MTN Ghana has been appointed to the chief
 Financial Office and Executive Director Rule of MTN Nigeria Effective, 1st March 2020.
 As a result, Cognat Ben-Saint-Chill has been appointed to act as Chief Financial Officer
 until the replacement process is completed.
 This process is underway, and we'll update the market once finalized.
 On this note, I would like to wish both gentlemen the very best in their new roles.
 In terms of the outlook for 2020,
 2019 marked the year of the customer for MTN Ghana and in 2020 we're building on
 that foundation as we transition
 from a traditional mobile telecoms operator
 to an emerging digital operator.
 as a business
 we're well positioned for continued growth as we invest in ongoing improvements in quality of service
 and a drive to increase participation of Ghanaians in all our service offerings.
 In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the year of the customer
 the digital experience
 with a firm focus on digital.
 The focus on digital is a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value
 for our shareholders.
 At this point,
 I'd like to hand over the conference call
 to the operator for questions and answers.
 Thank you very much once again.
 if you would like to ask a question
 please press star then one on your touch tone phone or on the keypad on your screen if you
 decide to withdraw the question
 Please press star, then two, to remove yourself from the list.
 Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then one.
 We will pause to see if there are any questions.
 Question?
 We have a question from Mangaliso Tlamini from J.P. Morgan.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi everyone, this is Mangaliso Jamini from J.P. Morgan.
 Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.
 Two questions from my side.
 one relates to the 2G license renewal
 Could you provide some color as to how much the renewal costs, please?
 and secondly on the mobile money services
 with the change in legislation and application for the new license
 Is this a simple administrative tick in the box or is there more to the process?
 Could you maybe just talk us through the process there, please?
 Thank you.
 Well, thank you very much for the question.
 let me start with a 2G license
 and the 2G license was renewed
 at $25 million.
 dollars. This was an
 industry renewal and both ourselves and Vodafone have this renewal and the
 validity or the tenure of the license was 15 years.
 In terms of the MOMO process, the new act, the PSSA, Payment Systems and Services Act,
 I believe the question was
 whether this was an administrative tick-in-the-box for the regulator
 or whether there was something else behind it.
 I think the spirit behind the PSSA, two or three things here.
 And the first one is in 2014, there was the EMI, which was the Electronic Money Issuer
 regulation that was passed
 which allowed
 telecos to take more responsibility and
 managing agents
 and accounting for customers as a customer of the More Money Operator.
 And before that, it was actually bank-led fully.
 And therefore, those assets were essentially owned by the banks.
 The PSSA is intended to expand on this by allowing FinTech, the broader FinTech community
 beyond the moral money operators
 to also have a framework
 under which they operate.
 That being said, that allows some sort of regulation and oversight for the fintech community that has an impact on the mobile money industry overall.
 but then the second thing was also
 after the banking sector cleanup
 was also to institute
 certain mechanisms that allow risk to be managed in a structured format so that we can prevent
 a similar situation from happening within
 the mobile money or the fintech space.
 And then the third thing is really to strengthen the governance processes
 and where the central bank themselves
 with a growth in more money over the last three to five years.
 have had to update their own internal processes
 for better governance and understanding of this space.
 So this would be the three main drivers.
 but certainly a positive framework from our perspective
 in terms of enabling the environment
 and looking out for a future that is going to continue to be dominated
 essentially by the mobile financial services of the FinTech companies in terms of how we
 managed financial services overall.
 Thank you.
 Our next question is from Pashendran Odayar from Nedbank.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi, everyone.
 and it's presented here.
 Just following up on
 Magalisa's question.
 So it sounds like, yes, that this new act is more encompassing.
 encompassing, but do you as management see any roadblocks in terms of actually getting
 this license or is it something that
 you've kind of like
 testing.
 And a second question on the regulatory front was I read somewhere that in December you did get fined by the regulator for service disruptions.
 can you give us
 an update on that.
 has that all been resolved
 and is it a once off thing
 or something that we can expect more of.
 Thanks.
 Thanks for your question.
 and I'll take the first question which was
 which was on the risks
 or any potential risks of getting the license.
 We don't actually foresee that to be a major constraint.
 Obviously, we have to also be diligent in our submission, which we have done.
 but we don't see any major roadblocks
 from where it sits at this stage.
 the process will
 will end in June and
 And if there are any changes, we'll update you through that.
 but we certainly don't see any risks from our position currently.
 In terms of your second question, which was about the sign and whether that's all
 the other thing?
 result.
 Yes, we received a fine for 100,000 Ghana CVs in December following the implementation
 of new services, and that situation was resolved within 48 hours of us receiving the fine.
 And I don't believe that we can expect any other fines in terms of the business.
 Okay, that's right.
 So the fine was 100,000 CD in total.
 if it wasn't per-subscribe or anything like that.
 No, it's 100,000 in total, that's correct, yes.
 Okay, no, thank you very much.
 The next question is from Moses Zawu from Bloomberg.
 Please go ahead.
 All right.
 Thank you very much.
 And my question is, now telecoms are moving closer to higher, you know, Gs.
 Why would you still want to renew your 2G license?
 That's my first question.
 My second question, are you indicating that there is potential for the coronavirus to impact your supply chain?
 Please give us some more details.
 Have you started getting any sort of impact?
 and if
 If you talk about potential, in what form could it become serious?
 Thank you.
 Thanks for the question.
 in terms of the 2G license
 and why we thought it was important to renew it.
 and just to give you some context
 Today, we have approximately 40% smartphones on our network, which means we have 60% of our users today that do not have a smartphone and rely on 2G services.
 Now, in as much as, you know, smartphone users have a higher
 app who, you know, the 60%
 even on the lower app
 which is a very significant component of the business.
 So, you know, we really have no option if we have to continue to grow the business forward to renew the 2G license.
 However, we're also expecting that in the next couple of years, we should see universal access license implemented by the regulator,
 which would mean that we can reappropriate the 900 and 1800 spectrum under the 2G
 for higher generations of technology.
 so we have that in mind
 when we're looking at the renewal.
 but we definitely didn't have much of a choice
 for the renewal
 since we have
 a huge dependency on
 on 2G currently in terms of our base
 in the mix of smartphones.
 In terms of the coronavirus, you know, our measures today are proactive and we're basically
 preempting a potential situation down the line so we haven't had any impact on
 business currently and but in anticipation of what may happen and
 And we're making sure we put in place the right processes
 to prevent any impact on the business going forward.
 The next question is from Jake Ward from Ashmore Group.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi, thanks for the call, guys.
 a couple of questions if I may
 Firstly, given the strong growth in the voice ARPU, I wondered if you could just expand
 a bit more on some of the initiatives that have driven this and your expectations for
 the business in 2020.
 then secondly
 despite the strong
 year-on-year growth.
 It looks like the mobile money revenue came in just a little bit softer in Q4 based on our numbers.
 Can you just give some colour on what drove that?
 Thanks.
 All right.
 question and the first one I'll take the first one which was around the voice app
 to what the expectations are for 2020
 and some of the initiatives that supported the voice business.
 so we see the voice business
 as a business that's gone from being the most significant business to now a business that
 we're managing
 forward
 and so by that
 we're minimizing our above the line
 campaigns in terms of voice
 and doing a lot of below-the-line campaigns,
 which takes us into an area called customer value management, CBM.
 So what we basically do in terms of voice is to look at profiles of customers and try
 to define specific products and services that suit the specific behavior based on the characteristics
 and the attributes of that particular segment
 or that particular user.
 So this has been, I would say, the primary mechanism to manage voice, in order not to
 impact the growth in some of the newer areas
 which would be mixes between voice and data uses.
 in terms of the expectations
 for 2020, we have a very strong desire to continue to drive smartphone growth, so we
 will expect to see the mix of smartphone and non-smartphone changing in favor of smartphones.
 however with the rate we've seen historically
 We won't suddenly change the baseline for the non-smartphone users.
 and would expect to see a reduction in that base
 but continue to still be significant and strong.
 As such, the activities on CVM will continue, but the focus to drive growth and secure the
 future of the business will be
 largely driven by the smartphone base, what we do in terms of apps, my MTN app, music
 apps and gaming
 and things like that, as well as the enhancements in customer experience to ensure that we can
 and drive more transactional activity.
 So that would really be the focus for 2020.
 In terms of the more performance,
 There were some changes in Q4 which impacted the year-on-year revenue growth.
 and the most significant of which is
 Part of the PSSA meant that there was a change in how the interest revenue on Momo Float was distributed.
 And that change would have given us an additional...
 or without that change
 it would have seen an additional 10 percentage point growth in MoMo.
 So that's the primary driver of the drug.
 But the organic business continues to be very strong and we expect to continue to see that
 growth in 2020.
 That's great.
 Thank you very much.
 The next question is from Joyce Agboizel from Data Bank Brokage Limited.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi. Thank you very much for this call.
 my question
 relates to the cost efficiency that I see in the business.
 So looking at the current figures that were posted, you notice that the cost declined or reduced significantly for some of the major cost items.
 I want to know what drove that.
 Thanks for the question.
 Now, just when Dupre is on the line,
 and you would respond to that and the costs.
 Right. Hello. Thanks for the question.
 And the cost of efficiency is mainly on both fronts, on the cost of sales.
 So we were able to optimize our relationship to the international careers.
 so we had a lot of savings on
 um
 income in international commerce and then on the OPEC side we also had some
 optimizations reviewed various
 contracts that we had
 with the service providers
 and leverage on our sites.
 So, basically, what we've done is to optimally, to continue to try to optimize our operations,
 such that we'll get those
 synergies going
 forward and you're going to see much of that
 in the coming period
 to
 So continue that.
 All right. Thank you very much.
 The next question is from Floris Sienkamp from Coronation.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi there.
 I also have a
 I have a question on the payments license.
 I mean you briefly mentioned the changes in Q4
 But I was just wondering, what are the main changes for your business under the new license?
 I mean, any services now that you can offer or can't offer, you know, or fees that you
 can charge or not charge, so just the main changes for the business, and then secondly
 Also on this, what are the costs involved?
 if they are
 one source
 license fee or an annual
 annual cost
 related to this
 And then lastly, there were talks in the past of a 30% local ownership requirement for mobile money businesses.
 and I'd just like to hear your thoughts
 on what's the latest on this and
 Does this new license address that at all or is this still something that's a bit of an
 issue?
 Thanks.
 Okay, thanks for the question.
 So just very quickly on the first part, which is what were the main changes.
 So the two significant changes in terms of the business,
 And mind you, the call business continues to run.
 there are no significant changes
 or no changes at all on the core business.
 however in terms of the interest on float
 that's where the changes happen
 So before the changes in Q4, the float interest was split 80-20, where 20 goes to the operator like us and 80 goes to the customer.
 The changes there have been a reduction to the operator, so it's no longer 20% to the operator.
 is now 10% to the operator
 and 90% of the customer.
 But also what has changed here is the interest on float, which is regulated by the central bank.
 And that number was 7% prior to Q4 and has been reduced to 4%.
 So the entire interest scheme has changed for the float earnings.
 So these are the two main changes.
 However, on the operational side, in terms of the products we offer that we've built
 internally, there's no impact on that portfolio at all.
 In terms of the 30% local ownership, the PSOCA has clarified the 30% ownership now, which
 was, which
 is
 in terms of
 30% is measured on the capital required to get the license.
 And so for us to be a dedicated EMI, which is called a DEMI, D-E-M-I,
 we need a minimum capital requirement of 20 million Ghana cities. The local
 ownership is 30%
 of that 20 million
 Capita Required
 which is the six million Ghana cities, for us.
 the process now and to finalize that but it's a pretty straightforward activity now and then what
 what had been suggested in the past.
 Our next question is from Douglas Holm from Decan.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi, guys.
 Thanks for the call.
 I was wondering if you could just give us what the voice, data, Momo, and digital revenues were for 2018 and 2019.
 Okay.
 Okay, just bear with me one second.
 So, total voice revenue.
 I don't know if I got the last part, but total voice revenue was $2.318 million.
 Sorry, 2.318 billion Ghana cities.
 and data revenue is 1.461
 and mobile money revenue is $959 million.
 And what about the other digital revenue?
 digital revenue
 just bear it ask one second
 And if that's not in there,
 $199 million
 in terms of digital revenue.
 Okay.
 and then
 it looks like
 Momo was down about 23% in the fourth quarter.
 is that
 Is that what you guys have as well?
 because we're trying to back into a fourth-quarter number here.
 Sure. There was a question earlier on what drove the change in the MoMo trend from Q3 to Q4.
 and it allows you to change
 in the interest scheme
 both on the flow of interest and the split between customers and operators.
 right
 So I guess the business, the peer-to-peer payments, the transactional payments,
 Can you give us an idea of how much that grew year-on-year?
 so most of the key lines
 I mean, the more money drivers would be cash-out revenue as well as peer-to-peer revenue.
 cash out is about a 60%
 and peer-to-peer is about 30%.
 And both of those are trained at about the same rate as a total business of about 28% year-on-year growth.
 And then just in terms of the 30% local ownership requirement, you know,
 six million Ghana CDs of ownership, I would assume that the
 IPO
 already
 satisfies that requirement?
 So that determination has not been made yet.
 we submitted the application
 and the central bank
 is currently reviewing that,
 So we'll get the response to that in due course.
 But yes, the $6 million in terms of the value of the business, it's quite a small amount.
 So we don't expect this to be a hurdle to achieving localization from the perspective of mobile money.
 And then what was the management fee amount in 2019?
 Okay, so I'll just pass that to Modupa 2 Handle.
 Right. Excuse me. The management fee amount was 192 million.
 Okay, and then...
 Gotcha.
 And then in the direct network costs,
 um,
 You know, they appear to have fallen year-on-year, but I believe part of that is just simply moving lease costs,
 operating lease costs out of the direct network operating costs.
 so, you know, I guess
 The $624 million, if you wanted to look on it, apples to apples,
 do you add $430 million for lease costs?
 You add 430 million, that's correct.
 Just one last question on kind of the outlook for 2020.
 I mean, can you guys give us some high-level thoughts on, you know,
 revenue growth by the major buckets, Voice, Beta, and Momo.
 Okay, we don't have that split, but our overall guidance is, you know, we maintain our overall
 guidance in the perspectives
 for you guys to read.
 Okay, and what about margins?
 As well with our guidance, we should be tracking our guidance for margins as well.
 Okay.
 Great.
 Thanks, guys.
 The next question is from Timothy Rashouk from Frontura Capital.
 Please go ahead.
 Hey guys, this is Rafe on for Tim.
 I have quite a few questions.
 Just starting out with mobile money, KPIs, a couple that you've mentioned in the past.
 The first one, I was just wondering what transactions per user per month looked like for 2019.
 and then
 and I guess total amount of remittances as a portion of mobile money revenue
 or mobile money transaction volume, what the yearly transaction value was for the mobile money product,
 and then any updates on your subscriber market share.
 All right.
 So I don't know if I can answer all of them immediately, but we'll certainly get back to the ones that I missed.
 But let me start with the transactions per user per month.
 And so the two most popular transactions, which will be in line with the revenue splits as well,
 with P2P and cash out.
 and it's typically five transactions on P2P
 and five transactions on cash out pay use of the money.
 In terms of cash-in, it's very similar to P2P at 4.5 transactions per month.
 And these would be the three main transactions.
 The rest are really small transactions
 that are continuing to grow
 we're seeing good growth in merchant payments
 and bill payments
 but the transaction frequencies are quite small.
 In terms of the update on the subscriber share, just to clarify, is that subscriber share in
 mobile money or is a subscriber share
 on the core business.
 Yep, I would take both subscriber market share numbers, both Momo and the core business.
 one way to call business
 Okay.
 Correct.
 Thank you.
 So in terms of our core business market share,
 we're at 55.2%
 in terms of the core business
 at the end of 2019.
 In terms of the remittance percents of total revenue, remittance is about 1.6% of total revenue.
 and in terms of our
 Mobile Money, subscribe, share.
 we're at about 74%
 and I believe those
 will be the questions
 that you asked.
 Yeah, and then I just had a couple of follow-ups.
 So, one, that 74 is – last year you were at 94, right?
 So that's a significant drop.
 I guess, what has led to that 20 percentage point change in market share?
 Okay, so just to clarify,
 and
 the value
 of the
 94% you refer to
 is actually their share of the total transacted value.
 and on that
 basis we're still above
 90% and the subscriber
 share has remained about the same
 in the marketplace as well.
 So these are two fairly stable numbers, despite the 28% growth in the business.
 I hope that clarifies you.
 Got it.
 And then did you give a number for yearly transaction value?
 I think last year
 your transaction value was 151, or maybe 2017 was 151 billion CDs.
 and I don't think
 out of the 2018 number, but I was wondering
 what the 2019 transaction value was.
 Sure.
 We'll come back to you on that.
 we just have to rely on the disclosures
 by the central bank
 so it's consistent
 So we'll come back to you on that.
 Okay, sounds good.
 And then last question.
 And so just seeing the obvious operator split of the interest off the float come down and
 And then the interest rate that's being, you know,
 charged on that, or accreted from that float.
 is this something we're going to see
 another part of the cycle in four or five years
 and updated
 another updated act where that could strip down to
 you know the operators
 taking no share of interest income off of the float?
 Is that where we're headed?
 Got it.
 No, I don't believe we will get to the point where there's no interest for operators.
 you know I think this trend was really
 facilitated by trying to promote
 one more
 more interest back to the consumer
 which is where the 90% came in.
 in terms of their
 of the reduction in the interest rate
 itself
 this is
 something that a central bank has managed in,
 And we've had quite a tough financial industry.
 there was a restructuring
 last year
 so that's all driven by
 Sorry, that's the result of some of these activities.
 So I don't expect to see major changes to these numbers going forward, but certainly not get into zero interest.
 got it
 and then
 just final question on,
 subscriber growth
 for mobile money
 it looked so
 So active data subs were up, I think, 9.5% for the year.
 and then
 and I'll act
 active
 Sorry, active mobile money subs were up 4.6% for the year.
 And then overall, Mobile Money subs were up one.
 Do you have any view on an acceleration or deceleration subscriber numbers?
 and what is the lever
 you're looking to pull here sort of converting you know the the inactive subscriber to an active
 subscriber or you further
 They're focused on monetizing.
 the actual subscriber growth
 kind of on the
 back burner now and you're more focused on the monetization of what you have or how do you think
 about that strategically.
 You know, you're absolutely
 Last year, there was a bit of a focus on monetization and launching more advanced services.
 But certainly, we've started this year on an acquisition drive.
 So we should see growth.
 we should see continued growth this year as well.
 Got it. Awesome. Thanks.
 The next question is from Wamar Ismaili from EFG Hermes.
 Please go ahead.
 Yes, thank you.
 Thank you for taking the call.
 So, please, could you name some of the existing partner banks that you're working with on
 the Momo wallet
 That's my first question.
 Second question is,
 Does the Payment Systems and Services Act change the nature of these relationships?
 and if so in what way
 and then my last question is
 on the reduction in the interest for float.
 That's come down from 7% to 4%.
 Is there a provision in the existing act that allows for revision upwards should rates in the market change?
 Thank you.
 All right, thanks. I'll have, would you answer the first two questions, which are around the banking relationships, and then I will take the question on whether we expect, on the provision in the Act that can affect the interest rates.
 So I'll start with the provision and now I'll know what some would do after that.
 In terms of the provision, there is no provision in the Act itself.
 And, you know, the four and the seven percent are not governed by the act.
 These are more operational tactics by the central bank.
 So there isn't a provision per se.
 however these are
 these are discussions
 will continue to have
 with the Central Bank
 on trying to maximize the opportunity with interest going forward.
 I'll hand it over to Modupe to handle the question on bank partnerships and the implications.
 Well, it's out of this bank,
 partner bank, there's nothing like change.
 the guidelines
 doesn't
 stipulate any changes, so we still maintain
 the relationships we have
 with the partner banks
 and also trying to increase that ecosystem as it were.
 I'm not sure I got your second question, if there was a second question, but I thought, if there was, please, can you repeat it?
 Yeah, so I was just asking, I don't know if it's a long list, but if it's a short one,
 just asking for the you to name the the partner banks that you work with on the
 Momo Wallet.
 Oh, we work pretty much with most of the key banks.
 what's the name
 the echo bands
 The GT, SunShot
 Pretty much fun.
 to pass around
 at least that we're working with.
 Thank you for that.
 The next question is from Nityanand Bhatt from the Can Value Investors.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi, guys. Thanks for the call.
 A quick question to continue this discussion on this float, on the float part of the business.
 Can you give us a sense of the total value of float generated by Momo during the year 2019 and how did it grow versus 2018?
 All right.
 Um,
 So, Joe, I think the...
 The first sign for MTN was in excess of 3 billion CDs.
 and
 was a
 healthy group
 I'm just trying to get my numbers in a second for results.
 It's simple.
 yeah
 so the

 I'm not.
 it with an MTN mobile money platform as it was, but like Selon did, they were waiting
 for the official
 articles to be published
 by the Central
 bank, which is pretty much
 in that light.
 Begin now with what I've just said.
 Okay, Ken.
 Sorry, just a second.
 just trying to get the exact numbers for you.
 So it was $3.4 billion as of December 2019, compared to $2.43 billion as of December 2019.
 got it
 Got it.
 And typically, what is the duration of the float?
 how long does this float stay in, you know,
 if you put 100 Ghana CD on day one,
 how long before it goes into the system again?
 Well,
 Okay, so
 that's what
 can answer the question as long as
 the subscriber
 has an electronic
 walnuts
 it must be bad by cancer, which is a clot.
 So as long as those wallets exist, then the floats must be represented by the cash.
 so the numbers
 we talked about,
 the 3.4 billion series
 are the cash value
 of the electronic, develop the electronic wallets.
 So how long it stays in that ecosystem depends on what some of the things Selam talked about, the transactions,
 how much you're able to keep within the ecosystem
 and how much is actually cashed out of the ecosystem.
 but given the numbers
 we give
 that I just quoted, 2.43 billion
 at the end of December 2018 compared to $3.4 billion
 that 2019 does show that
 the

 them. So you have
 increase in my chance
 my sentiments
 the
 agent footprint
 and things like that, that's actually
 who's in the whole
 move-by-money ecosystem.
 Understood, understood.
 and
 the partnership with the
 banks, right? So,
 the interest
 that you get on the float
 You said it's going to be split 90-10 now, 90 with the customer and 10 with you, with Momo.
 how does the interest rate
 compared to the deposit rate
 that the customer would get if they just put the money in the bank?
 Okay, so two things.
 Finally, for most of the reason,
 think if you look at the mobile
 money wallet
 as a
 silver
 our current account
 where you currently earn zero.
 no interest on
 your balances on your current account.
 then you will look at the mobile money product as the next person
 because you could end up to 4% or thereabouts on your Mubarak money floats.
 So if you look at those two, which is the proxy for each other, basically,
 It's either you have your money, your current account, or your mobile money wallet.
 so you have
 the ability
 to earn
 interest
 phone one,
 whereas you have no ability to earn interest on the other.
 So that's how it compares.
 last part of the exchange
 I mean, that's by the interest rates.
 The interest rates are regulated by the bank, by the central bank, so they are kept low.
 increased dialogue on that
 with the industry so that we can
 get more value
 for the subscribers
 But at the moment, that's what it is.
 It's been regulated by the central bank.
 And like Uragi said, the whole objective is that those floats or those monies belongs to the subscribers.
 and as such they should be remunerated
 that's calling me
 So what the new Payment Services Act has tried to do is to codify that in black and white.
 that 90% of the money generated on the floats
 should be
 send to the subscribers.
 And that's what we're doing.
 Next question is from Ali Nasser from Virgin Acid Management.
 Please go ahead.
 I thank you for the opportunity to ask questions just to follow on on the
 interest rate structure scheme.
 just curious whether you've seen
 any change in behavior
 perhaps
 and, you know,
 the incentives that maybe
 contributes to the wallet today.
 I heard
 you're
 and talk about the difference between the current accounts
 in the wallet
 but
 it's done
 Generally speaking, have you seen any change in behavior towards people contributing to
 of flows via the wallet as a result of the change in the interest rate fee?
 Thank you.
 We like the first one, too.
 Right, okay, if I could take that, I think the two ways you could look at that, one, the
 You may have heard that your float balances are growing from 2.43 to 3, over a billion, more or less, in a year.
 That's almost about 50%.
 shows that
 it's attractive
 to some
 that's when
 to
 Most of the people
 in the mobile money ecosystem
 There are those who are actually on the banks
 who probably could not have access to a banking account.
 So, having been brought under the auspices of financial inclusion, obviously, they would continue to invest in that activity or continue to partake in that activity.
 So I'm not sure it would be right for us to compare like for like
 Because most of the bulk of this, the majority of these people were outside of the financial system.
 it. So I think
 So in as much as they float their brain due to the activities that people can now do on their mobile wallet,
 I think you're going to see that number potentially increasing.
 At what rates, I can't say, but I could definitely say that the interest may not be the major driver of why people are coming to the ecosystem.
 system.
 more of the convenience and what they're able to achieve with having a mobile money
 wonders.
 That's clear.
 The second question, I think you alluded earlier on in the call to value-added services, such as pensions and things that are outside of the P2P transaction type.
 Can you talk about the percentage of value
 percentage of transactions that's coming from value-added type services in the
 the Momo ecosystem.
 The question was on what was the contribution of the advanced services in mobile money.
 Is that correct?
 That's correct, yeah.
 It's about 11% in terms of the contribution.
 And it's safe to say that that 11% carries a higher margin
 compared to kind of the traditional P2P business?
 That's correct, yes.
 Because a traditional business has a commission from cash-in, which doesn't apply to this.
 so
 care
 about
 the
 That makes sense.
 The last question is just on management, please.
 Just to remind us, does MTN group charge any management fees on Momo revenues or EBITDA?
 just wanted to get a sense of that
 Well, at the time, we submitted our application to the GIPC.
 so that's all
 All total company revenues was the intent, and that's what's in the guidance given.
 So the money rent fees are actually for all services.
 bear in mind that
 even the platforms
 maybe
 more
 Money Platform is supported by
 you know
 group technical
 and stuff like that
 So that's the concept.
 when we actually applied
 Thank you for the, for the, for the, um,
 I'm in, Steve.
 approval to total revenues, which included the revenues from what is now mobile money
 Okay, so just to confirm it does include
 mobile money.
 So, was that a question?
 I just wanted to confirm
 you're saying that the management fee would include
 Revenue for mobile money from Momo.
 Yes, as at the time when we submitted the application, that's what was approved for.
 Okay.
 and those monetary fees have been charged
 and have been remitted up to the group.
 Yes, they've been charged, and they've been, those are the earlier figures we quoted, and they've been charged into the Indian financial system.
 Understood. Great. Thank you, guys.
 The next question is from Binta Drave from Blakeney.
 Please go ahead.
 Thank you guys for the presentation and the time for the call.
 I just wanted to quickly ask you in terms of the merchant payment and merchant agent, agency network,
 what's the evolution year on year
 and the second question is regarding the
 impact of the changes in regulation
 the PSA, the new PSA
 Act, that's the impact
 of this on the
 Q4 mobile revenue?
 what should we expect for the
 for the full year
 2020. Do you think
 some of those changes
 will be
 offset by
 increase usage or do you see an impact coming true in 2020?
 20.
 Okay, so let me answer the second question first and then we'll come back to the first question.
 So in terms of the changes for 2020, we'll expect to continue to see strong growth in mobile money on the revenue line.
 and the focus really
 more money is to continue
 who drive
 met on payments
 and which today
 is about 2%
 of the total revenue
 but we should see that continue to grow as we gain more merchants.
 in terms of the year-on-year
 and we ended last year with about 80,000 merchants
 and we're finished.
 sorry, we ended 2018 with about 80,000 merchants
 and we finished 2019
 at about 100, over 100,000 merchants.
 So we should see good growth this year as well in terms of merchant services.
 But more importantly, we should see an increase in the transaction per merchant with the merchants
 that were newly onboarded last year.
 So we would expect some good growth from that.
 Thanks.
 The final question is from Kin Allal from SSNIT.
 Please go ahead.
 Hello, thank you for the opportunity, and congratulations on your performance.
 I see a lot of the banks now coming up with their Momo business
 and I want to find out if
 from your
 projections, how far
 these banks, businesses
 affects your momo business.
 Thank you.
 Sure, thanks for the question.
 and I think it's too early to tell
 but if I just sort of take
 an industry
 perspective
 where the more
 money industry
 is still, you know, very, very young.
 the opportunities
 for transactional activity is massive.
 If you look at the stuff that I gave to an earlier question, I mean, customers are doing
 it.
 p2p's per user per month currently and then and about five cash out per month per user i mean
 That's a very low number.
 We should expect that, you know, in its mature state, you should expect 20 to 30 transactions per user per month.
 On the basis of that, I think, you know, having new entrants in the marketplace that can allow customers to get more used and comfortable to digital currency would continue to help the industry and the ecosystem continue to expand.
 So at this stage, it's very difficult to tell the direct impact on us as a business, but
 But I do think that as an industry, we should expect the industry to continue to expand
 And quite rapidly, the more the players come in and help us develop the ecosystem.

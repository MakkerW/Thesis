 thank you for standing by and welcome to the evolution mining December 2021 quarter results call all participants are in a listen-only mode there will be a presentation followed by a question and answer session if you wish to ask a question you will need to press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad I would now like to hand the conference over to mr. Martin Cummings general manager of investor relations please go ahead thank you Darcy good morning and welcome to the evolution mining December 2021 quarterly conference call as Darcy mentioned my name is Martin Cummings and on the general manager investor relations this morning on the call we have Jake Klein our executive chairman Laurie Conway our CFO and finance director and myself in our group office in Sydney Bob Fulker our chief chief operating officer and Glenn Masterman our VP discovery and business development are dialing in it has been a tumultuous couple of years and as expected gold's role as a safe haven during those times has been demonstrated as the pandemic was breaking in early 2020 we saw gold rise from the lower 1500s per ounce to an all-time high around 2070 in August that year we started 2021 with the gold price down from its peak at just under US 1900 per ounce the economies were surging as they emerged from COVID lockdowns and equity markets were printing new highs Bitcoin was continuing to generate a lot of interest with some touting it as a new digital gold and exposure to any metal that ended up in a Tesla was highly sought after gold couldn't catch a bid in early 2021 and the sell-off was brisk down to 1680 by March gold equities would follow and by the end of September the GDX index of senior gold companies had fallen about 20 percent year to date with the GDXJ junior index even lower down around 30 percent but in the last three months things have turned developing economies are now dealing with soaring inflation with the Federal Reserve now indicating it will need to respond with rate increases soon the Omicron COVID variant spread quickly leading some countries to reintroduce or extend lockdowns and restrictions and recently Russia and Ukraine tension has Europe on high alert bitcoin had an incredible journey in 2021 but has now given back most of those gains gold's role as a safe haven is returning and we now trade back up around US $18.20 per ounce for Australian gold miners the Australian gold dollar gold price also went on a wild ride but we currently sit within 10 to 15 percent of its all-time high these really are great prices to be selling our product at and of course copper had a standout year two rising around 25 percent evolution is well placed to benefit from this with our copper production materially increasing from this month with that I'll now hand over to Jake to introduce the December 2021 quarterly report thanks Martin good morning everyone welcome to the call thanks for joining us and happy new year despite the industry headwinds covert labor shortages and unseasonal rainfall our teams did extremely well to manage the impact as planned and first articulated to you in July we anticipate the second half of the year to be materially better than the last six months and are on track to deliver our guidance given the first half performance at red lake we expect to be in the bottom half of the production range and between the mid and top end of the cost guidance range last quarter our portfolio was significantly improved by securing 100 percent ownership of the iconic Ernest Henry copper gold mine we also concluded the sale of mount cotton to naval minerals and whilst retaining exposure to the future of the operation the sale allows us to focus on our larger higher margin assets we continue to be consistent and diligent in the implementation of our strategy of improving the quality of our portfolio and being laser focused about putting ourselves into a position where we can generate sector leading returns on the capital we deploy in our view this is the holy grail in our industry and is the true measure of a gold company's performance over the long term I visited Ernest Henry last week and left very confident that in the December quarter we concluded what is likely to prove one of the most transformative deals in evolution's history it is an outstanding operation with a great team and terrific geological upside we look forward to hosting a number of you there for a site visit in due course the foundations for the transaction were put in place in 2016 when we secured the economic interest in the asset and since then have built a strong and mutually respectful relationship with Glencore that allowed us to negotiate this deal on a bilateral exclusive basis over the course of of a few months last year our economic interest delivered 79.5 million dollars in cash flow last quarter and now with 100 of the operation being included from 1 January we expect its impact to be even bigger going forward the cave extension pre-feasibility study will be a priority and with intersections 400 meters below the study area and still open below that Ernest Henry has a long and very exciting future Cal performed extremely well and managed to deliver to plan in spite of unprecedented rainfall and COVID interruptions the underground project which will grow Cal's production to 350 000 ounces per annum remains on schedule and budget I was also fortunate to be able to visit Red Lake in November last year due to COVID travel restrictions this was my first visit since we took ownership of the asset in April 2020 Red Lake is one of the best commercial opportunities I've seen in the gold sector in my career for the combined purchase price of 650 million US dollars being Red Lake and Battle North we have secured a district scale tenement position with 11 million ounces of resource and significant exploration upside seven kilometers of prospective strike with associated mining infrastructure three mills and 700 million dollars of Canadian tax losses in time this asset will be transformed into plus 350 000 ounce a year low-cost producer this is how value is created in our sector as you will hear from Bob who has just returned from his third visit in the last five months progress is being made last quarter we consistently achieved over 1200 meters of development each month as a result of this and other improvements we are confident of a material and sustainable improvement to production in the next two quarters we expect this higher production to drive the cost per ounce lower and i'm looking forward to visiting the operation again with lorry in the next few weeks frustratingly mungari remains the only asset in our portfolio that we cannot currently visit we are fortunate to have a good team in western australia have led the kandana integration which has gone well and we are growing increasingly confident about the future and the potential of this operation mount rawdon was impacted by heavy rainfall and was forced to process the low-grade stockpile material strategically we continue to assess the potential of mount rawdon to be converted into a pumped hydro generator which could be a significant contributor of renewable energy to the southeast queensland grid at the end of its mine life this last quarter the highlights for the discovery team were good intersections at kew in western australia and also more intriguing and exciting intersections at red lake where there is plenty of open space and interesting geology to discover another high-grade zone glenn and his team are also plotting and planning the next phase of drilling at ernest henry whilst we are managing industry headwinds we should not ignore the significant commodity price tailwinds a gold price of over 2500 australian dollars and a copper price which going forward will represent around 20 percent of our revenue of over 13 and a half thousand australian dollars per ton evolution is well positioned to benefit from this i'll now hand over to bob to provide some more detail on the operational performance thanks jake and good morning everyone the december quarter saw our triff stabilize at 9.4 the highlight being a 35 reduction in the 12-month moving average at mungari the december quarter gold production is the first reported without mount carlton's contribution the quarter's gold production was 148 000 ounces with a five percent improvement in the oil and sustaining cost to 1347 dollars an ounce despite the challenges faced with above average rainfall and covert cal had a strong quarter delivering 60 000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of 998 dollars an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of 80.6 million capital investment ramped up at cal with 60 million spent on major projects this quarter this included 24 million on the iwl and 33.5 million on the underground development underground development rates will ramp up in the march quarter with the second jumbo commencing in december and the selection of the primary mining contractor is on track for the march quarter the project remains on budget and on schedule the iw stage 2 deposition has run smoothly throughout the quarter ernest henry produced 21 000 ounces of gold and 4.1 thousand ounces of copper at an all-in sustaining cost of a negative 882 dollars an ounce the higher aisc compared to the september quarter is primarily driven primarily driven by lower copper production due to lower mining planned uh lower planned mining tons the net mine cash flow remains strong at 79.5 million another significant contribution to the portfolio i'm pleased to say this will be the last quarter reporting ernest henry as an economic interest integration activities are well underway and i'm excited to have the ernest henry team as part of the evolution family the pre-feasibility study for the mine extension below the 1125 rl has commenced and will incorporate the recent drilling results indicating mineralization extends further than assumed in the concept concept study completion of the study is expected in h1 fy23 moving on to red lake over the past five months i've been on site three times each time i see an improvement in step change in performance and develop and delivery although still work in progress pleasingly many key metrics are moving in the right direction red lake produced 20 000 ounces for the quarter and although they're all in sustaining cost is not where we need it to be the operating mine cash flow for the quarter was a positive and we and we spent 13.9 million in sustaining capital and 36.9 million on major capital for future production for the past couple of quarters i've been talking about development pleasingly during the december quarter each month was above our long our long-term transformation goal of 1200 meters per month the december quarter was 21 higher than the september quarter i expect this to continue allowing additional mining fronts to be opened campbell mill continues to do achieve new records and approval has been granted to lift the daily throughput restriction of 2 000 tons per day for a limited trial in the second half of the financial year to support the campbell mill expansion while still not where we want them to be there's been significant improvements through the quarter so cycle time has improved by 25 percent stope idle time has improved by 60 percent time to drill per stope has improved by 27 percent and slot drilling has halved with the v30 implementation stope extraction quality focused has delivered a 19 improvement in stope recovery a three percent reduction in dilution and a 15 increase in our all mind quarter and quarter and in december the of the grade lifted to 4.9 grams per tonne looking forward to h2 we're expecting expecting to see a continual improvement in delivery from the underground and the two mills operating notable improvements for the second half of the year tons processed will increase with the red red lake mill running and the campbell mill rate extension grade mine mine is lifting as dilution reduces and plans for early ore from the cyd development continue increased tons from koshner the transfer haulage locomotion locomotives performance has improved by 43 percent last quarter and replacement locomotives will be commissioned this quarter further reducing downtime and increased number of mining horizons and continuing the improvement in stope design and execution to further enhance our ore delivery and quality munguakdari is moving forward post integration for the quarter they produced 34 000 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of 1829 dollars an ounce and generate an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of 20.7 million ore grade processed increased 34 percent over the last quarter as a proportion of underground ore in the feed increased from 54 to 67 percent workforce integration is ongoing with a focus on establishing a one-team approach the sharing of resources across the field has commenced and enabling better deployment of equipment and resources to priority areas which has been a been critical as a site navigates high vacancy rates and covert related impacts mount rawdon produced 12.4 000 ounces at an annoying sustaining cost of 1842 dollars an ounce and an operating mine cash flow pre-capital of 11.9 million as previously mentioned weather significantly impacted access to the pit resulting in reduced oil movements as a result stock file feed increased directly affecting gold grade and production in summary some great improvements made at red lake and mungari throughout the quarter the cal underground project continues to hit milestones and the official ownership of the earnest henry mine has added additional opportunities for the portfolio thank you for your time and i'll hand over glenn thank you bob and good morning everyone firstly at our queue joint venture in western australia we've advised our partner musgrove minerals that we will be taking full management and operatorship of the project which occurred on january 1st of this year recent results from diamond drilling at the west island prospect outlined on page 15 of this morning's report importantly confirm the potential for high-grade mineralization within individual loads drilling has also identified multiple new load structures in the favorable dollarite host in various locations along strike the geometric relationships between structures and dollarite imply individual loads may be limited by their potential strike length that remain open at depth the air core drilling program has been very important in further delineating the favorable dollarite host and associated golden gold anomalism along strike from the original west island drilling the results have unlocked new areas with the necessary geological ingredients for mineralization to occur up to five kilometers from west island one of the challenges with all of our drilling programs is long delays waiting to receive assay result results in time to inform where to drill next this is an industry-wide issue and is holding back the ability to accelerate drilling programs in the ways we would like to at queue we are still waiting on results from five diamond holes and over 70 air core holes which restricts our ability to sensibly add additional drilling resources at red lake two deep holes were completed as wide space step outs from the original intercept reported last quarter on the r zone extension one of the holes intersected high grade mineralization 200 meters away from the first from the first hole with the other hole drilling through the structure however it did not return significant mineralization the results reported on page 12 are encouraging because they unlock a large area of real estate that has not been previously drilled along the extension of the r zone structure follow-up drilling is currently stepping off the high-grade intercept in hole 69 to expand the potential scale of mineralization in this area at mungari drilling underground at kandana and east kandana continues concentration on small resource extensions and classification upgrades on future mining areas adjacent to existing development step-out drilling into the foot wall of the k2 structure from the underground at hornet has returned further promising intercepts of stacked load style mineralization at star trek follow-up drilling is underway to understand the significance of a laminated vein in hole 2130 reported on page 14 of this morning's report the geology is similar to what would be expected on the main k2 structure at rhp which is worthy of priority follow-up drilling at ernest henry we have assessed h2 drilling priorities which will be focused on developing all body knowledge for the pfs along with de-risking areas of the resource that require additional data support before production is scheduled as bob and jake mentioned earlier strong copper gold mineralization has been intercepted at the 480 meter rl and remains open down plunge with that i'll hand over to lori thank you glenn and good morning everyone this morning i'll provide a brief update on the financial performance for the quarter as outlined on pages 9 and 10 of the report for the group we produced 148 000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of 1347 per ounce this aligns with our guidance where we said the production would increase over the year and the all-in sustaining cost would trend down from around 1450 per ounce in the first quarter the aisc was approximately five percent lower than the september quarter our focus on portfolio quality is evident in that on a light for light basis the divestment of mount carlton operation reduced our all-in sustaining cost by 28 per ounce this quarter as our production and cost profile changes in the second half the cost benefit from this divestment will improve further group production and cost guidance remain unchanged at 670 to 725 000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost 1135 to 11.95 per ounce with the performance of red lake in the first half we expect to be at the bottom end of the production range and between in the top half of the cost guidance range in terms of cash flow we were fairly well in line with plan excluding the underperformance at red lake we generated 203 million of operating cash flow which is up 4.6 percent and 13 percent excluding mount carlton on a per ounce basis our operating cash flow was up 10 percent quarter on quarter this was against a flat gold price and lower copper revenue where the higher copper price was offset by planned lower copper volumes at ernest henry net mine cash flow was 53 million with our capital programs remaining on plan we invested around 34 million dollars in sustaining capital or major project investment increased to 114 million as projects and cal and at cal and red lake progressed group capital guidance remains unchanged at 150 to 175 million for sustaining and 440 to 505 million for major projects we'll see an immediate benefit of the acquisition of 100 percent of earnest henry where our aisc will reduce materially in the second half of the year more importantly though our cash flow will be increasing based on our guidance and depending on the copper price achieved in the second half we expect to realize an additional 80 to 130 million dollars of net mine cash flow at ernest henry this will be taken into consideration when determining our interim dividend as previously announced during the quarter we successfully priced the us 200 million us private placement for nine years at very attractive pricing to partially fund the ernest henry acquisition this will be drawn down next month we ended december with 1.15 billion of cash and net debt of 450 million our unaudited gearing is around 12.6 percent prior to the payment for ernest henry in early january we are on track to be below the 29 percent projected at time of announcing the acquisition and we expect to quickly be back within our targeted gearing levels and maintain a very strong balance sheet i look forward to updating you next month on the our fy 22 interim financial results thank you for your time this morning and darcy please open the line for questions thank you if you wish to ask a question please press star 1 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced if you wish to cancel your request please press star 2. if you're on a speakerphone please pick up the handset to ask your questions your first question comes from david radcliffe from global mining research please go ahead hi good good morning jake and team so my question is on red lake the the commentary around mining rates does seem uh you know more optimistic today which is great uh especially with respect to i guess the mine efficiencies and dilution and and opening up more mining rates uh fronts so just trying to think how we should think about you know the high development rates converting into higher mine tons over sort of this year and if you can maybe provide some sort of quantum how that comes through over the next couple of quarters uh and then on grade how we should sort of think about those numbers over the year obviously there's going to be the sweetener from Campbell but you know when do we from the operations today how do we move closer to that preserve grade of six given that currently sort of signal for thanks david uh those are good questions um i mean i think we you know we are going through a transformation you know we've called it a three to five year transformation at red lake uh the last six months have taught us a lot about the operation uh we've focused on the development and we've we've specifically taken the decision to i suppose sacrifice production over development and getting ready and setting the trunk the transformation up and we now feel that we've kind of bottomed and we're at a point where you're really going to see improvements in that um so the development rates are up uh the improvements in in mining are getting better uh as bob highlighted and he can talk further to it you know dilution has been reduced uh we're comfortable that the models are performing um we need to open up some of these higher grade areas which are going to be happening over the next few months um so it's a it's a journey uh we're on the right path um and you are going to see uh material improvements to production and lowering of costs uh in the next quarter and following quarters bob do you want to add to that yeah thanks uh jake uh david as jake said um the expectation is that as we get the development in uh to the new areas and it takes a long time uh to to go out and to open up new areas then the mining fronts will open up which will help stabilize and increase the the tonnages we've started to see an increase in tonnages last quarter through the quarter um although it's not as high as we need it yet but it's still it's growing um and areas like aviation and the like uh they do take a bit of time to to set up so uh i would expect that um over the next couple of quarters we'll start to see those tonnages come in uh as jake said also on the grade um you know we are getting a lot better um with the reconciliations of um dilution and um and the like as i mentioned all the all the numbers um i expect that over the coming quarters we will see um that continue to to improve dren did you want to comment on the model specifically sure bob i think um you know one of the things that we're starting to see david is that um particularly with our reconciliation so our dom the grade control and our dom 2 or reserve um we're starting to see an upward tick um you know particularly on the grade front as as we improve particularly some of the you know the mining related factors as bob has just described dilution recovery um and and we've improved our grade control system so we we are starting to see that upward tick in the grade uh and particularly on a three-month moving average it's uh it's starting to trend into the direction where we need it to be so we we have confidence uh that the models um you know are performing uh to plan and and we're just aligning that with the the way we're mining and and um yeah we're confident that we'll start to see that where it needs to be over the next coming quarters i just uh conclude um that david with a comment around the fact that we've owned this asset for 21 months um it's only been in the last five months that we've been able to visit the the operation uh but when we bought the asset in april 2019 we said our three-year goal was to get to a run rate of 200 000 ounces of gold uh and then a longer term five-year um horizon of 350 000 ounces a year and we are committed to delivering that uh on both 36 month and 60 month targets great thanks very much guys i'll pass it on thank you your next question comes from al harvey from jp morgan please go ahead yeah morning jake and team just um couple from me just with um ernest henry and and the study so we've got about 18 months for the pfs um just wondering if if this is going to um take on much of the work that glencore did or if it'll be kind of a complete re-cut incorporating that those further depth extensions and i think glenn you mentioned it was going down to 480 meters um and still open beyond so where potentially could you um would you kind of draw the line on on those depth extensions and and and where this study will kind of finish up yes so the the just to clarify the study will be um delivered in the second half of this calendar year so first half of fy23 so we kind of uh say nine months away to from delivery of that um it will build on um the concept study which was completed by glencore i suppose one of the things which we found intriguing as we've looked at the concept study um is that it was determined really on the basis of um minimizing the capital expenditure which meant that the depth extent of the concept study went down to as far as the decline could go and you could truck material up uh so it wasn't constrained or limited determined by geology it was more determined by how far can we develop how deep can we develop which was kind of four to five year mine life extension um with a decline development and not needing to uh spend significant capital so the priority was really minimizing capital expenditure and extending mine life um by which which constrained it to that four to five years so our pre fees will look at that as well uh but we'll also look at some longer dated options as to whether there is potential to extend it even further beyond that which certainly from my site visit there was a lot of optimism from the site team that that was uh possible yep thanks jake um maybe just quickly on red lake um you got the approval for the higher throughput trial how long will that um trial last and then and then what are the permitting steps that will follow by that there bob do you want to take that question yep thanks al um the um the trial is actually we've permitted for a a six to eight week period of basically unlimited throughput through the campbell mill and the reason we want to uh we wanted the trial was to determine how far we could actually push the uh the mill um so uh really it's uh it's a short period of time uh that will allow us to then uh be able to go and actually seek the the approvals for a permanent lift um at the moment you need an engineering study and we actually believe that we can actually get um all the data we need um out of this trial to be be able to go and actually seek the permitting thanks bob and if i could just sneak one more in just with cow there was a small contribution from um the underground this quarter i thought we were kind of going to expect that a little bit a little bit later so is this is this material a one-off or can we kind of expect uh underground to start contributing more and and seeing that ramp up over the next few quarters bob uh we're on track for the the time frame that we've actually spoken about earlier uh al there will be minor uh contributions coming through as we uh develop through uh different zones uh but it won't be significant in the immediate future um but we're on track to deliver first or as we said uh i'm just trying to remember exactly the time frame i can't remember sorry i'd have to go and check it jake no i don't think there was any contribution or material contribution from the underground it remains on on track and on schedule yeah no worries thanks thanks jake and bob cheers thank you your next question comes from daniel morgan from baron joey please go ahead hi jake and tim uh just on red lake um can you just run through on why fy 22 guidance is still achievable albeit at the low end of the ranch um it does imply the next two quarters have got a very strong production run rate of over 50 000 ounces i guess we're at the end of january so you should have visibility on that data but um it just seems a big lift you know what what is underpinning that do you have you know high grade stopes available is it you know running this trial um of the the plant you know does that give you more production just you know how is guidance achievable yeah dan thanks i mean we've specifically said that group guidance is achievable um we're not going to make the the asset guidance at red lake um but you know we we're not feeling um that we want to be granular enough to say you know how much we can produce because all these all these steps are in in on in place and are showing improvements um but on a group basis and i think that's what investors should look at uh you know we are confirming that we will make our guidance range all right i must i might have misinterpreted the comment that it was a group comment apologies um just on red lake maybe taking a step back could you maybe break out um what are the critical elements that need to be in place for the for the turnaround to occur because obviously a lot of these are not in place at current whether that's equipment whether that's the um you know the access to the up the upper campbell or or the mill through ports can you just unpick you know when these pieces to the turnaround will be in place or expected to be in place and you know when we can expect that sure bob you've just recovered from jet lag from your latest trip there so over to you thanks jake and thanks dan um as we talked about earlier the big one to start with was getting the development to open up new areas um but post that we've actually been working on uh the stope turnaround cycle um and the the time to initial from initial development through to a filling of a stope so we're going to keep the sequence going for the next um for the next stope which comes along right right beside the previous uh filled stopes so we've been working on uh long-haul drill rates we've been working on pace fill um placement we've been working on re-entry times as well as um as stopping and turnover of the actual stopes so all those together is really is what is enabling the lift last quarter of our autumns by i think it's about 15 percent from the from the previous quarter so that comes around because we can actually get into the stage quicker and and more regularly um if we actually look at the additional uh mining fronts what it enables us to do is actually spread the mining fleet out so that interruption and uh disruption uh from interacting activities is limited even further so that allows us to actually turn the actual cycles quicker because we actually don't have the same disruption factors um a big one for coming quarters is koshner uh and last quarter uh the the um the high-speed tram or the uh the uh locomotive that takes the all from koshner across the reed shaft that improved significantly from the previous quarter and and that is one of the main things that allow us because koshner has got a good turnover cycle of its types already did i sort of try to answer it uh when uh when is access coming to the to the upper campbell um for instance so what sorry go ahead go ahead i was just going to say the upper campbell um so the cyd is actually accessing the upper campbell and we're already down into um that area uh with the cyd first stope ore was always said to be around about 12 months after so and that still is on track um we will get minor amounts of of development or earlier the same as at kel i mean as you as you go through areas you'll you'll intercept some sort of minor um all zones um but anything from the start will still be within that 12 months from first starting jake do you want to add anything to that no other than that you were walking around it uh last week and you um you felt positive about the you know the outlook over there i mean i suppose the thing that i would add to all this commentary on red lake is that each time someone's been there and particularly bob has made several trips um you know there are no red flags with respect to our delivery of this it's getting uh our operational efficiency uh better down and you know i still believe this is as i said in my commentary uh this is an amazing commercial opportunity where we've acquired assets that need transformation uh it's going to take some time uh we've had a few hiccups in the last six months but you know there are no red flags with respect to delivery and transforming this operation i guess jake on that comment about the the ore tonnages or or the potential ore within that uh campbell zones uh daniel i i walked 9 11 14 and a few other levels this time and it's it's right for the taking it's just the access we've got to get there so that's what's taking the time thank you and last question would probably be a bit simpler um just mongari um just the numbers on page four can i just get a confirmation on whether these are equity numbers or or do they have jv production in them i just want to make sure i'm treating like with like here sorry yeah dan so the the physicals up up the top will be 100 of what's processed when we're talking about um gold production silver production that is our equitable share so we're wanting to show um what the actual mining and processing has been able to do okay thank you thank you thank you your next question comes from levi spry from ubs please go ahead uh yeah g'day uh happy new year thank thanks thanks for the call um can i just follow up on dave and dan's questions there around red lake um bob can we get the tons and grades the second half and do i assume that the three year 200 000 ounces means that we're going for a 50 000 ounce per quarter run rate into the you know 12 months or whatever it looks out to be 10 months i think before bob answers that i i'll have a good happy new year levi um yeah yes is is the is the answer to your last question you know to get to 200 000 ounces we need to get to consistently doing a run rate of 50 000 ounces per quarter um we'd prefer not to kind of break down into tons and grade for the next six months because we just feel we want to build confidence ourselves uh on a group guidance basis we are comfortable we'll make the the guidance range but would prefer just to give us give us another you know couple of months to just get comfortable that these that these changes that we're seeing are going to be repeatable and consistently deliverable yep okay thank you thanks jake thank you your next question comes from alex barkley from rbc please go ahead hi jake and team um first a quick one at cal it seems like sustaining capex is maybe running a bit low on an annualized basis is that um is there a reason for that or should we be expecting a lift in the second half larry yeah alex it is just basically um timing more than anything um we expect that their second half will will lift i mean the primary focus in the first half was getting the the underground and the iwl projects continuing and in the second half you'll see some sustaining capital come through all right no problem and uh a quick one at red lake uh just to follow up on what's been asked so for for the second quarter can we confirm that there was no grade reconciliation issues uh yeah there was dilution but that was improving uh and in the in in the month of december we felt very comfortable that it would we addressed some of the issues that we're getting in terms of both dilution um and um and we feel confident that the models are performing to plan yeah okay yeah i was sort of talking about the model but you've answered me there thanks very much guys thank you your next question comes from matthew friedman from goldman sachs please go ahead sure thanks morning jake and team um i don't want to labor the point on red lake and you did kind of just touch on it there jake but i'm just wondering you know you've highlighted on the call and in the report a number of ways that you know tons are improving and volumes are improving you know we can see mining rates lifting development rates lifting but obviously grade keeps falling um you've been underperforming the reserve grade for a year now so i guess you know does that mean we'll see an over performance at some point um is there a need to rethink some of the dilution assumptions and other factors that underpin that reserve grade you said you know you're comfortable with the way the model is performing at the moment but i guess there's another year of data on this asset um you know now uh i guess lead lead to any sort of expectations or anything that we should think about at the next um mineral reserves uh i'm sorry mineral resource or reserve update um you know anything to think about in terms of that yes thanks matt i mean a good good question again and bob and his team have been doing a lot of work on understanding that and and again we came to the we are of the view empirically that the models are performing to plan but bob maybe you can give some color as to some of the issues and then hand over to glenn to just give some guidance on the on the mri yeah no problems how are you going matt um the number that i quoted uh when i was speaking that was the december number so the number in the report is um is an average for the quarter of 3.95 and in december it did lift to to 4.9 which is starting to show out some of the uh dilution uh issues that were i spoke about being under control it's also showing some uh improvements in uh drilling accuracy and um and the like within the stoves so it's actually starting to improve significantly and that's why what jake said about we're pretty confident on the on the models um we're working on all those things are we where we need to be i still think we've got improvements to be had so i still think that there's there's further uplifts to come um but it is actually all moving in the right direction so it's pretty pretty pleasing um glenn did you want to talk uh comment on the model yeah thanks bob yeah matt um i think uh just a you know really i guess a bit of a preview um you know on our mrr update which will come out with mid next month um as you'll recall when we when we when we did the sort of i guess the evolution update to bring it in as compliance uh you know with with jork um we consolidated the models from over 130 to 19 principal models um in the last 12 months um we'll we've had new data and mining from six of those models so so they are the ones that um you know we're going to be revising you know into the mrr annual update we're not seeing you know really any material movement in in the resource and that's from a tons and grade perspective um and and assuming that the same cutoff grades as we previously have which is around about three and a half grams per ton on you know on a mineral resource basis um we do um you know what the the new data that we're collecting is really confirming uh some of the geological interpretations um there are some small changes there'll be swings and roundabouts you know in areas where we didn't have you know as much data support as we would have liked but that uh that's to be expected so i think you know all in all um we're not expecting to see any material change um um sort of you know year over year in terms of the actual geological model and how it informs the the resource estimate and i think from sort of looking at this in a great amount of detail bob and the his technical team and glenn and the resource you know we are confident that we are addressing the mining issues um and you know with good mining practice uh we should be able to get the grade that is in the models got it thanks jake and thanks for the context glenn um just secondly uh on ernest henry um and obviously congrats to the team on closing that transaction over christmas and and the new year i hope they did manage to get some kind of a holiday but um just wondering in terms of you mentioned that the the copper production during the quarter was a bit lower than than sorry the lower copper production during the quarter was i guess to plan uh and potentially that's attributable to to lower grades quarter on quarter um that asset is still mining above reserve grade for copper in particular just wondering when we should be thinking about a roll-off back to reserve grades for that asset you know did we see that in the december quarter um and then you know i guess similar to the to the last question you know anything to think about in terms of incorporating that uh reserve and resource into your next update you know now that that's being reported on 100 basis i believe it's already a jork standard resource but yeah any any movements there to think about um now that it's fully uh evolution ownership yeah thanks matt glenn do you want to just comment on on the resource yeah sure jake so so on the on the resource matt we yeah we will be providing an update um mid next month which will incorporate you know information uh up until about may last year which will be the um when when glenn core did their their last resource update so it'll be update reflecting that point in time and it won't incorporate all the drilling information that uh we've collected you know between may and december um so that will obviously be rolled into our mror cycle as we go ahead uh you know this 12 month period uh to to really incorporate all that information in in addition to the the new drilling that'll be um that that is in the plan for this year and matt just on the production it was it was a combination so in the in the quarter we had a shutdown uh which was a planned shutdown and it also um a shutdown in the mine so we we did end up with some lower grades coming through and as as we look at the the rest of the year you do see that the average grade being mined um is is coming back down certainly from where the first quarter was and the second thing that did impact on on copper in this quarter were some finalizations of of the previous quarter's um uh concentrate sales so that did have a bit of an impact on the on the copper piece in particular so it's you what you'll see if you look at it uh as a half um you're going to see that then flow through into the second half as a pretty well a light for light if once you gotta think once you gross it up to 100 obviously right got it thanks laurie and uh thanks for the comments glenn thank you the next question comes from mitch ryan from jeffrey's please go ahead good morning all thank you very much for taking out the questions um quick question with regards to um red lake but but more of a longer term dated question just wondering if you provide an update on battle north and the acquisition there specifically around the milling capacity um part of the the rationale for that was was to potentially bring that that milling capacity online um can you give us an update on the permitting processes for that how much attention is actually being able to be spent on that given the focus on just i guess consolidating um the base level of production in the existing red lake operations sure uh bob over here yeah thanks the um so the battle north um processing plant um it's it's there it's operational if we wanted to start it we are um replacing uh some parts that um uh need replacing the big issue at uh at the uh the bateman plant is the tsf and we're working through that at the moment um for the next sort of uh 12 odd ish months uh our capacity at red lake in campbell uh are going to be enough so that's what we're we're doing the permitting and all the work to bring it in on time um when we actually need it um from the rest of battle north uh we're still doing work in the underground um we're doing some drilling that uh drink will talk about um so we've done some grade control drilling over there uh just to grow our knowledge on the on your bodies as well okay thank you that's it for me thanks mitch your next question comes from stuart mckinnon from the west australian please go ahead oh g'day jake and team um i was just intrigued by the um uh the mention in the quarterly about uh up to 15 of your workforce being um effectively knocked out at red lake and cow at various times because of covid um you know obviously uh you know cover hasn't hasn't been sort of awash in the community as it has in those those other places canada and new south wales uh in wi are you expecting that you know eventually you're going to have those have to the same challenges at your wi operations in terms of covert and managing the workforce as you do at red lake and cow and how much or more of an impact is that going to be given that you know you're already sort of uh short on workers given the you know the wi situation with a you know a labor market shortage just generally in the resources industry yes that's that's a good question um look we're obviously watching it and monitoring it very closely um and you're trying to put in the contingency plans and the learnings which we've got from managing it and we've managed it effectively uh at red lake and cow um but you know unless there is a some someone finds a cure uh for covid which does not seem to be the case because people who are triple vac still seem to to be catching the omicron uh variant uh in in new south wales and canada and around the world uh then you'd have to think that at some point in time if west western australia opens up uh omicron is going to is going to spread through western australia so we are going to do our best to put in contingency plans but if you couple that with a skill shortage uh it does put uh the whole mining industry in western australia at at some risk all right thanks thanks for that jake thank you your next question comes from nick evans from the australian please go ahead um sorry about that just juggling my phone um g'day g'day team and just um just to follow up to this question jake just in terms of new south wales in particular how are you sort of thinking about the the spread of somicron in new south wales you think that sort of cow or your operation there have seen the worst of it or what are you expecting this kind of level of absenteeism to um continue for some time and just in terms of wa i i thought i detected a sort of a note of frustration in your voice when you talked about not being able to have um not being able to visit it i mean do you think that um in terms of dealing with the inevitable spread in wa that the state government should have bitten the bullet and and done it now or do you think there was um you know there was some benefit to delaying the reopening in wa uh thanks nick i'll answer the second question first yeah our our preference would have been to have the western australian border opened um earlier um you know it just seems like you're in some ways deferring the inevitable uh by keeping it closed as i said earlier unless there is a cure which is not on the horizon um it is going to be present and it is going to have to be dealt with at some point in time even if it is deferred um it's not going to be eliminated um it does feel like other places uh like new south wales and ontario and the rest of the world is learning how to manage this um and certainly at our operations while it has been a big distraction uh we have been able to manage through it and uh we are getting more comfortable that we can we can manage it um it has um distracted the management teams a lot um but with proper process and um proper protocols uh it can be managed effectively thanks i appreciate that thank you your next question comes from jim pollack from um sabbaton associates please go ahead yes good morning everybody and uh thanks uh jake um i think it was you who said in your introduction that the second half of the financial year uh would be materially better i was just wondering where we can expect to see uh material uh improvements um in in which operations yeah jim i think thanks um uh there are two areas which i'd say you should look out for uh the one is red lake uh that we've spoken about at length on this call um we expect to see a material improvement in production and reduction in costs over there uh and the second one is the acquisition of ernest henry will be uh fully incorporated into our results on a hundred percent basis from the first of january uh and that will also have a material impact all right good i wasn't going to ask well i thought i'd be a little bit different and not ask any questions on this ernest henry but thanks for uh including that answer um given the uh the rain problems you've had in in new south wales and queensland um just for example in uh at mount rawton what uh what tonnage of material low-grade material do you have stockpiled that you can keep the mill running on i think we have very significant uh low-grade stockpiles that's not the issue the issue is more uh we want to access the more profitable um low-cost uh answers in the pit right but uh there's um if you had to depend i'm i'm this is a hypothetical question if you had to depend a hundred percent on uh stockpiled material you have many years ahead of you uh i assume uh many years life left yes we do right okay um what's the what's the situation at cowl uh large stockpiles there yes very large uh stockpiles there as well um that's what we're treating before the uh we got into the stage h cutback which we're now treating all grade materials so um very comfortable there as well yep good okay finally look i've been asked to ask you what what's your best contact uh way of contacting you uh dr sandra close did attempt to uh well did did try to contact you or did contact uh the uh the office uh before christmas but got no reply what's what's the best way of uh her getting something to you i think if you go through the the website um we will respond to it no right all right good okay fine that's me thanks very much thank you thank you your next question comes from anthony barrett from snp global please go ahead hi jake i'm just wondering you mentioned early on about uh some of the headwinds that seem to be front of mind just wondering just for the gold sector you know um how much are they front of mind in in the context of what's going on in the bigger picture and you know and are you i'm not expecting any crystal balling for the gold sector or anything here but are you overall more optimistic than not you know for the for the uh coming year yeah i'm very optimistic i mean we've repositioned our portfolio to be profitable right through the cycle as we've said um we've been if you take our portfolio 12 months on from the beginning of 2021 to the end uh it's it's materially better we did the mungari transaction we uh the condona consolidation uh we did the um the ernest henry transaction and we did the um the battle north transaction to consolidate red lake so from our perspective you know the strategy remains the same uh focus on quality over quantity return on capital um and you know benefit the gold price is over 2500 australian dollars an ounce um i did reflect on the fact that when i started in the industry it was 300 an ounce so yeah if we're not happy at 2500 an ounce um we need to find another another sector to operate in we're we're excited and happy about it um yeah the fed reserve meeting this morning told everyone what they knew interest rates were going to go up um i didn't see anything that people should have been surprised about in in that meeting so now this my my question about the overall uh over optimistic um i was more referring to yeah that's our macro picture so you when you refer to the us fed there you're obviously saying that's implications are that's for the for the gold sector that's obviously looking good for the for the coming year christopher i think the you know the question which everyone's asking um jerome powell the the fed reserve chairman made the point this morning that inflation is way higher than their target and they need to start raising interest rates and and managing and and um reducing their balance sheet yeah that's the question yeah is the fed going going to be able to do that uh and do it in a way that um that is uh is not disruptive and okay if i if i were someone and i uh who needed uh insurance i'd be buying gold and gold stocks like evolution okay thank you thanks thank you there are no further questions at this time i'll now hand back to mr client for closing remarks uh thanks uh thanks everyone for participating appreciate it won't be long before you speak to us again uh with the release of our interim results in the middle of february so look forward to updating you then um and look forward to being able to hopefully with travel restrictions reducing uh to be able to take you to ernest henry uh take you to red lake uh and and also visit cow where there are lots of changes happening because seeing is really believing so thanks thank you thank you that does conclude our conference for today thank you for participating you may now disconnect

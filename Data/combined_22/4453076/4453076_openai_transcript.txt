Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Telekomsel continued to report 69.5 trillion in revenues, increasing 3.1% year-on-year. Expenses increased by a slower rate of 2.8%. This has been a better performance. EBITDA grew by 4.7%, while net income increased by 13.3% year-on-year.

The digital community as a unit of the portfolio of revenue and profitability. EBITDA grew by 24.2%, supported by additional subscribers and better outcomes. The income grew by an increase of the dividend rate of revenue from 15.5% last year to 18.5%. The digital profitability of the dividend improved by 47.4%, a significant increase from 35.6% in the first half of 2020. During the first half of 2021, the number of subscribers at around 285,000, much close from digital marketing activities and internet of new lines. Meanwhile, our pool inflows to 217,000. In second quarter from 256,000 in the first half of 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, Telekomsel's positive performance amidst challenging demographic business environment. Telekomsel's revenue in the second quarter of 2021 grew by 3.5% as compared to the previous quarter. The number of subscribers almost 10 billion, a significant increase of 41% year-on-year. The digital business from leaders in the nation is consistently increasing and reaching 37.4%. This is the end of the second semester also grew by 4.7% year-on-year to 26.4 billion and 17.3 billion of Telekomsel's digital companies. Digital services grew by 28.1% among the digital products, digital lifestyle, advertising, and enterprise solutions. The first month has fully grew by 12.2% to 8.7 trillion with other services accounting for 37% of the total for the first month of the year. Their stock position is moving in our general position. In the meantime, postal and e-commerce business reported revenue of 6.8 trillion increased by 1.2% year-on-year supported by increasing positive data center and e-commerce activities. In the period, post office clients visited from digital activities of more than 40% of Telekomsel's consolidated revenue and more than 30% of Telekomsel's consolidated income, reflecting a more diversified business. Ladies and gentlemen, Telekomsel continues to get synergy and collaboration with digital and technology companies. After the successful implementation of MAME 2021, an MOU with the company Gigant. In August 2021, Telekomsel signed a final MOU with Microsoft to explore cooperation in the development of intelligent intelligence, development of digital talent, and acceleration of Telekomsel's digital transformation. Telekomsel's capability and MBI's demonstration from capability and performance. MBI portfolio has strong on expanding performance in terms of impressive values, agility, and significant activities. MBI has invested in more than 50 startups in our cloud countries, of which three companies have done IPO and six companies have been successfully acquired by third parties. Microsoft and MBI have two unicorns and 34 other companies are expected in the next unicorn. This achievement MBI has brought positive impact on Telekomsel's digital business. We are building up capacity in Jakarta and in the country. Today we have 26 data centers, 21 domestic and five overseas, with total capacity of around 43 megawatts. In 2021, data centers have generated 750 billion in revenues or increased by 11.7% year on year. To adjust our capacity increment, we are in the process of developing new set of data centers, which is a hyper-scale data center, specified as a 5G3M4 in a total area of 65,000 square meters new data center. Our hyper-scale data center will be completed in 2022 and the first phase is expected to be completed by end of 2021 with a capacity of 25 megawatts. At the final stage, data center capacity is approximately around 45 megawatts. In power business, after the successful implementation of the power assets, we have 23,000 square meters with a net value of 1.57 as of June 2021. Together as a standalone company, we have a revenue of 3.2 trillion in the first half of 2021 or grew 10.8% year on year. The revenue has increased also in 36.8% in first half of 2021 from 59.7% in the first half last year. The alignment of stock portfolio within the group is expected to enhance the current value and at the same time the next step up to include more focus and vision on its core businesses. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude my remarks, let me share our mind guidance for the year of 2021. One, we expect the specific revenue to grow by low to mid single digits. Second, the digital margin is expected to be relatively stable. Third, the digital activity of the group is expected to be around 25% of the previous excluding additional capital on 5G. That is ending my remarks. Thank you. Thank you. We are now open for Q&A. Ladies and gentlemen, we have our first question. Yes, first question. The first question comes from the line of Kamil Kaldin from HSBC. Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity. Congratulations to the management team for the great results. A couple of questions. Firstly, on your mobile business, could you share some light on the competitive dynamics? Do you have a direct height likely to sustain and what are the potential levers for our food development in mobile business? Secondly, on data...

and it will work for our people development in mobile business. Secondly, on data center, what is the total capex envelope for the new hyperscale data center of 100 megawatts? And how much has already been spent on that? And if you can share in the first phase, like 25, we know it's coming, how much of that capacity is already pre-told? Thank you. Hi, this is Rachel. I'll take your first question regarding the mobile market's competitive dynamics. I think to your question, which is, are the tariffs high sustainable and what's our outlook on ARPU? Just to recap, at the end of quarter one, Telkomsel had a really good set of statistics noted industry. It's necessary to hope a healthy pricing practices in the mobile market. We need to look for the output of the group and the profitability strong as an industry. So we have stopped and we have increased our prices, progressively increased over the last few months. And of course, we have increased our prices. So I think we are really back at changing the prices in stages. So I think in terms of ARPU and being ARPU, we should be seeing a healthy pickup. However, there are also a few different reservations into the nation now. There's a certain mix of COVID base now that's working. There's been more customers in and the Q has not picked up yet. So those will be some of the challenges we might foresee when it comes to ARPU. Nevertheless, we will see that we are expecting ARPU to stabilize first and then improving over time. I hope that answers your question. Thank you, Marjorie. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arthur from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. I answered that this immediately. A few questions. First one, housekeeping. If you can get some clarification on the OPEX items, like G&A and personnel expenses, these are down significantly. And just wondering if there are any one-off bookings that we should be aware of. That's the first one. Second question I had is to do priority with MBI investments. If you can get any clarity on that side. MBI has invested around $100 million into this. What size of things will be developing over these investments? I'm asking quite a few on the 2B reports on how big this thing actually is. And on the Microsoft deal, this is the question. What do you expect to see with this deal with Microsoft? Is there any specific target on revenue? Is there cost savings that can happen with digitalization? Thank you. Hi, Arthur. As I mentioned, the increase of G&A costs, it is because of income from 2003 or I think expect 2021 because we have quite many plans, quite many corporate actions that require us to have some expertise on this one. These are in my memory, company progress and development. And then on the result, I think the result is related to the last year bonus that basically paid in the second quarter of this year. This is performance related. Some also attributed to the, I think because the expected discount rate also declined, it means our exposures to the, I think pension benefits also increased on this one. And this is our basically pay to the contribution to the, I think contractual that we have with employees. But there is an outcome that is not kind of one-off. This will continue to be paid coming also to the end of the year. Just to clarify, Hatu, for these cost items, do you mean at these levels going into the next few quarters? That's how we should look at it? I think this is a bit right to manage the cost of employees going to be, I think slightly increased of course from 30 last year with exactly this one. But overall, I think we don't have any kind of something that kind of one-off that can make this one higher. It's right to manage over time becoming more, I think more aggressive. On the MBI investment, MBI basically around 900 million EPS. We already invested more than 50 startups in 12 countries. So far, what we can say that I think we compared the return and also we do kind of I think a bit of this with big folks. So this is the return that we have from this one. About I think operating in the same investment globally, that's the situation of our MBI investment. The size is I think quite variation given on their stage of the startup itself. $600 million has been deployed already or is at the fund size? The fund size I think in total from internal the fund is around 1700. Now in the process of I think we in the last 200 of 900. So I think we have quite many investment plans. On the Microsoft side, as you're aware that I think probably compared to other countries in terms of the influence of the retail facilities is less than half this year. So we think Microsoft as one of our steps to expose this market, the opportunity that we have. So it can be B2B but it also can be a B2B. We don't have to be B2B at this point. We just have to lay down our full detail of our plan continuing to be signed off the MOU. So at this point we don't have to have the number yet. And working with Microsoft is one of the partners that we have and we make sure that we will be out there similar companies. Because we do believe that IT consumption and user engagement is having a big opportunity in Indonesia. Thank you very much. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Song Kim Chan from CIMB. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for the call. This is Song from CIMB. Three questions from me. Basically follow-ups to the earlier questions. Firstly, on the mobile business, Rachel, you mentioned just now that we are seeing some categories with the next wave of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. So I just wanted to get your thoughts as to whether you think this potentially could see some risk in terms of the development of competition. Are you seeing some of the smaller players perhaps adjusting their prices trying to appeal to consumers because of the lower entrant power? Or is everybody just sort of holding steady and thinking that beyond this we will continue to see prices going up even including the smaller players? That's question number one. Second question with regard to the hyperscale data center, I just wanted to clarify again that the $70 million that was mentioned, this is

just for the first phase, is that right? And does that include the acquisition of the land or is the land leased? And my third question is in regards to MDI. You mentioned that the AUM is $900 million. Is that what we are tracking the AUM at? Or do we see that potentially going up further from the $900 million fund under management and MDI's current portfolio value in terms of the current values? Those are my three questions. Thank you. Hi, Pong. I'll take the first question. So Pong, you can read in the state COVID lines and also the PPPM that you mentioned. There is indeed a lower funding power from telecommunication, most of the telecommunication. So the operators are now moving to low denominations to actually address that affordability factor. So not to watch the same prices, but to watch making it more affordable in smaller denominations for the customer base. Hi, Pong. Under $17 million, it is for a first phase only and it is included in the land acquisition cost. And then on the MDI, of course, there's potential of going to increase the investment on this one. If you may know in this region, the growing of the digital startup is very high. And I think we still have many opportunities in the health, logistics, and others. So we still see that as our potential of investment to hike on this one. So I think we will continue to see this one as part of our strategy to go to the digital. Let's also be aware that whenever we are going to visit this company, we see also what is the disposition strategy that we can build with them. Both for growth external or growth internal by making our company more digital. All right. What is the current value of this digital investment? And another follow-up is you mentioned just now that the $17 million includes the acquisition of land. Is that the land just for phase one or have you also bought the land for phase two and phase three already? We already bought all the land for the three campuses that we have on this one. And then your question on basically what is the value of the $700? Unfortunately, we cannot disclose that one. For example, it will be one of the planned IPO of our investment in 2024. They already I think you already see in the market the value around $2.5 billion. We can have a gain around $100 million from this one if that happens. I think we can have one-on-one to have some color on this one. Okay. Understood. Thank you so much, Pak Harry and Rachel. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Niko Margulani from YRI. Please go ahead. Yes. Thank you. Thank you for the comment and congratulations for the good results for both teams. So basically my first question is on data centers. You mentioned there is about currently total capacity of around 43 megawatts. How much of that is used for telecom group purposes? And you mentioned earlier that is about 76% utilization capacity currently. How much of that is used for telecom internal purposes? That's question number one. Question number two is about what has been in the last couple of days I've mentioned in the media that there is a potential cooperation between PLN, iComPlus, and Telecom. Is this a new initiative or is it some project that has been worked from both sides extensively? And what are the scenarios that can be considered as a cooperation between the two SOEs in the physical band state? Thank you. Hi, Pak Niko. Thank you for the question. And utilization of this 43 megawatt capacity for our internal use, I think about 30% can be used for internal purposes. The rest is for the external purposes. And the intention of this data center is one of the parts of the data center ecosystem on telecom, which is self-removal to the global players, not for the local players. Thank you. All right. Pak Rachel, I think my question. Thanks, Pak Haris. So two questions. It's about how to start at the end of Q1. It's not so much a form of price hikes, but it was a result from unlimited. We had unlimited for about half a year. It was only launched in certain packages. It was only launched in certain packages. So we reduced the price of unlimited packages, but reduced more quarter. So in the RQMD level, or QPMD level, we might look more competitive or more value for customers, but we try to keep an eye on the consumer RQMD, and you can see that there's been strong reduction in RQMD, and it's stabilizing and hopefully will grow. So this is how we did that. In terms of Comcast, which is basically our business, our BPL for certain customers, we have also been using machine learning models to create an unlimited, the right packages for customers. So customers who are more in favor of low denominations, we will then promote low denomination kind of packages. And if customers are those who are using more and higher volume for higher periods, we offer them a higher denomination packages. So there's also offerings, different things like digital vouchers, etc. for those who are affected by the new wave of COVID. So there are various types of packages, acquisition packages and vouchers that we are putting out there. So customers from all

and the different kinds of affordability patterns. So you're picking out there. So tapping from all different kinds of affordability patterns, all kinds, something that is suitable for them. So we do hope that the competition can also correct the pricing. There have been some movements in the last two weeks and we hope this will continue and the index will improve the overall. Thank you. Thank you. Once again, as a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone. We have a follow-up question from Lain of Pius Chadi. Okay, please go ahead. Hi, thanks a lot. Two questions, please. First one, Indies Home. The ARPU has been lifting up extremely nicely. Could you share how is Indies Home doing about the ARPU outlook and subscriber education for the year? Secondly, on your partnerships with Coriant, you have detailed in your informal various initiatives which you have taken, but could you also share some tangible benefits accruing due to this Coriant partnership like subscriber education and revenue per user reduction in traffic, any kind of tangible benefits would be good to know. Thank you. We expect ARPU around the 7th of July. Given the fact that we have a first semester of 21, for the second semester of 21, we target to have at least similar new customers as we did in the first semester. But more importantly, the capital will be in line with our plan. So, answer your question? Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, thanks. Hi, this is a recommendation of the 5G. I think I need to answer this one. On the question about the driver use of our 5G in the first semester. And also we give the quality of the service and we increase everything in the first semester. And also we do the mind effort of the 5G. So, this is the first semester. Got it. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Once again, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone.

We will be doing things basically. I think this is not the issue that we will be doing on this transaction. But it is already in the plan of the company. So we will continue to do the transaction. We will have around 6,000 hours of this additional 4,000. And you will be able to transfer 1,000 dollars from telecom or is it from telecom service? We have a lot of money in banks and so on. This is not included in the transaction. What is the transaction for this 4,000 dollars? We are still doing the transaction right now. I think the financial ratio of Israel is around 1.57. This power, if you see the distribution of the power, can be set up in Java and the S in the outside of Java. Of course, I think this gives us quite significant potential in case of tenancy. Right, right. Thank you so much for having me. Thank you for your feedback. Thank you. The next question comes from Lionel Samuelson. Thank you, sir. Sorry, thank you for the opportunity. I have three questions here. The first question is on the guidance of dividend policy, if you have any. Understanding that pricing might be coming up, I want to hear your thoughts on the dividends. Thank you. Okay. I think on the dividend policy, basically we need to see the reason why it is expensive in the market. For example, that you can make one awesome dividend, of course, one dollar. Of course, right now we are not making too much. This might be next year. But the intention of the company is still to give the high dividend to our shareholders. Okay. Thank you. The next question is on this venture fund, MDI, that you guys have. I just want to understand a bit of the style. Are you guys more like SoftBank, where you will eventually exit? Or is this more of a, because I noticed most of the investee are part of your verticals as well. But do you guys plan to be a long-term investor for your portfolio companies? Thank you. Well, I think the more important is, as I said, is also what kind of investment you can give to your company. So I think we need to do this. And for the, I think it's a little bit of a mess. It can be a little bit of a mess. So I think we need to be in this one. And for the, I think it's a little bit of a mess. It can be a little bit of a mess. So I think we need to be in this one. And for the, I think it's a little bit of a mess. It can be a little bit of a mess. So I think we need to be in this one. And for the, I think it's a little bit of a mess. It can be a little bit of a mess. So I think we need to be in this one. And I think it's a little bit of a mess. We know that in the home, we don't have more competitors right now. On the front, we make a lot of, I think, depend on our market as well on this one. I think just going to improve, but I think more than work. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Is there enough for the questions? I would like to come to call you back at 3 o'clock. Please go ahead. Thank you, everyone, for participating in this call. We apologize for those questions that have not yet been answered. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

 We will conclude today's call with a Q&A session.
 As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question
 and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants.
 At this time, I will now turn it over to Vicente Renal, Chief Executive Officer.
 Thanks, Vic, and good morning to everyone on the call.
 I would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been
 affected by COVID-19, and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders, and
 volunteers who are on the front lines all over the world battling this
 pandemic.
 Thank you.
 I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll
 of our employees around the world.
 The pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce
 who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers.
 Every day I hear of new examples of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers.
 And I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times.
 While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future, one thing I am sure about
 is that Ingersoll Brand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving
 our customers at the center of everything
 we do.
 And that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees.
 Moving to slide five, I would like to grant everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times.
 When we closed the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated
 that within a matter of weeks
 we will be dealing with a global pandemic
 causing disruptions to our customers' supply chain
 and the day-to-day operations of the company.
 Our response speaks to how the IRX Toolkit has effectively helped us plan,
 access to the IRX Toolkit.
 adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities.
 First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers and the community.
 Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through this uncertain time.
 And finally, continuing to execute on the strategy of the company, as we have multiple
 categories.
 catalyst to drive ongoing value creation.
 Ingersoll run team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge
 from this crisis as a stronger
 and more unified company.
 The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values, as well as our execution engine
 that we call IRX, are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially
 in these unprecedented times.
 During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose.
 One that is centered around our stakeholders, where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better.
 This purpose, when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis,
 It creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company.
 And the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Rand execution excellence process.
 The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll Run.
 Turning to slide 7, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
 since it has been swift and focused around two major components.
 First is the health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities.
 And second, business continuity, not only within operations, but across the larger supply chain.
 Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 task force in February
 and had a full coordinated company approach in early March,
 just weeks after the creation of the new company.
 Our execution approach has served us very well as we are able to quickly implement enhanced site safety protocols
 and a mandatory work-from-home policy for those employees who can work remotely.
 And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful, as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base.
 But it's more than just implementing safety protocols.
 It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base.
 As a result, we have implemented a number of measures, including a Global Outreach Program
 to selected employee feedback.
 Our employees reacted quickly, and with a true ownership mindset, provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas.
 Not only did our team volunteer to take individual pay cuts, furloughs, and forego vacation time this year,
 They have thoughtful, in-depth suggestions, many of which we're actively implementing today.
 From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we previously communicated, we have seen plans largely in China, Italy, and India impacted due to COVID-19.
 China was largely impacted in the months of January and February
 and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April,
 as things are now largely back to normal.
 Italy and India saw about a two-month line to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April.
 And in this time, our sites around the globe are 98% operational, with India still being
 the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work.
 The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind us
 and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues.
 The Americas and EMEA regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online.
 In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers drop by more than half,
 which is a very good sign, and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible.
 Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain,
 and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of May,
 when governmental restrictions begin to ease.
 We are addressing the current environment head-on by actively managing those areas within our control.
 So let me tell you about what we're doing here.
 Starting with slide 8, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost-energy funnel to over $350 million,
 dollars, with increases across all major savings categories, and we continue to identify areas
 of incremental opportunity.
 As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction
 cost synergies of approximately
 $250 million
 by the end of year 3
 after closing.
 We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving
 these cost energies and the associated
 stand up
 of the new
 company.
 As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions, and that is exactly what we have done.
 We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions,
 with approximately $17 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020.
 The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months.
 as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization.
 In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative, with RFQs for nearly
 one-third of our historical
 direct materials plan base already launched
 as well as some quick-win initiatives being deployed.
 In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall Synergy target in 2020,
 which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10% to 15% realization.
 We're keeping the overall cost-energy target at $250 million over a three-year time frame
 At this time, they remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and I2B, given
 the current environment.
 It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out, but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins.
 So let's move to slide nine to talk about that.
 In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro-forma basis,
 we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA decrementals to less than 30%.
 with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments.
 We expect that these additional actions will yield $40 to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year,
 with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter.
 We will continue to re-evaluate on a monthly basis, and if the mad environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year, we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly.
 But we're making some tough decisions to control costs.
 one area that we're not
 cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise.
 Much like we did back in 2015 at Jordan Denver, when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities.
 We're following the same playbook today.
 Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years,
 We continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives, such as demand generation and our IoT platforms.
 This is all part of a strategy to play offense,
 now especially as we bring the two companies together
 through the integration.
 Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity.
 The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity.
 At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt
 for placing the new $1.9 billion
 out a term loan to close this transaction.
 All of our debt is a term loan-based structure with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR plus $175, and the EURO component is a EUROBOR plus $200.
 The Ethereum Loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027.
 Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion, as we finish the quarter with $556 million
 of cash on the balance sheet and over $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities.
 As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash.
 as we remain very prudent
 on preserving liquidity.
 Opportunities exist across working capital and cash taxes.
 And we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year
 year as all $825 million of legacy fixed insurance rate swaps will expire by September of 2020.
 though we feel our level of liquidity is proper
 were evaluating incremental debt
 or other liquidity vehicles
 given the attractive rate and covenant environment.
 environment.
 Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering.
 You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy.
 as we're building the culture of Ingersoll Rand with our employees at the core.
 We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity.
 And at the same time, we will position the company for future growth, both organically
 and through opportunistic targeted
 bolt-on M&A.
 Our business operates in a very fragmented market, and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio.
 And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape
 as we launch several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already.
 Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead, and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain macroeconomic landscape.
 I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials.
 Emily?
 Thanks, Vicente.
 On slide 12, you will see the as-reported financials for the company.
 As a reminder, the reported financials include three months of Legacy Gardner Denver
 and one month of the legacy Ingersoll-Rand industrial segment.
 in Q1 2020 and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019.
 As a result, the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction.
 I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result, other than to mention that the
 as-reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition,
 restraint.
 restructuring and other adjustments, which you can see listed in the
 reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation.
 Turning to slide 13.
 To assist in clean comparatives for the quarter, we provided
 supplemental financial information, which treats the transaction as if it had happened
 as of January 1, 2018.
 From a total company perspective, FX adjusted revenue and orders declined 14% and 7% respectively
 and were impacted by COVID-19.
 Regionally, we saw notable declines in Asia Pacific, as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe towards the end of the quarter.
 most notably in the IT&S segment.
 This led book-to-bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter.
 delivered 208 million of adjusted EBITDAs, a decline of 24%, driven
 mostly by the volume declines
 in ITNS and the expected downturn in the HPS segment.
 the EBITDA margins.
 were 16.4%, down 200 basis points from last year.
 However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited
 decremental to 29%.
 In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company, the legacy Gardner Denver business
 delivered $97 million
 as compared to our original guidance expectation
 of approximately $100 million,
 which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment.
 The legacy IR businesses delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March,
 as opposed to a combined $60 million for January and February.
 Moving to slide 14.
 Free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as-reported basis, including $8 million
 of CapEx.
 The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction, comprised
 of $38 million of synergy delivery and stand-up related costs and another $25 million of transaction
 fees.
 We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter,
 which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement, bringing our total
 transaction related outflows in the quarter to $100 million.
 From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times.
 And while we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we have shown the ability
 to delever historically.
 As you can see on the right side of the page, we'll remain extremely disciplined on cash
 and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically.
 Specifically, internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down, and opportunistic bolt-on M&A.
 Okay.
 We have no plans for any share repurchases
 or a dividend at this time.
 I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segments.
 Vicente?
 Thanks, Emily.
 Starting first with industrial technologies and services on slide 15.
 The IAT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million, down 9% versus prior year, excluding offense.
 Adjusted revenue in the quarter was $796 million, down 17% excluding FX, and leading to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 times.
 From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid-30s,
 with Europe down 15% and America's down 7%, all excluding effects.
 We use this trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out, meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in America's NMEA in the near term.
 This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business.
 But we're staying highly active with the man generation activities and pricing controls
 Well, we continue to demonstrate.

 generating over 1% in the quarter.
 While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment.
 We break this out into two areas, aftermarket and original equipment.
 For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data.
 As we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected
 to our remote monitoring systems.
 In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few
 of March of nearly 30%.
 with some recovery in the past few weeks of April.
 We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus,
 While at the same time, using it as a leading indicator for active market activity, which
 is approximately 50% of the compressor business today.
 Our original equipment were using demand generation leads.

 more than 1,000 leads per week.
 We have a lot of commercial insight in our system.
 We saw in the latter weeks of March,
 was a drop of 30% versus
 as what we saw earlier in the quarter.
 with similar trends in America and Europe.
 We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April, but still
 approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year.
 Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective.
 We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers, and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits.
 We have spoken about third-party industry reports in the past,
 And the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies.
 According to a leading third-party report, the market in the U.S. was down mid-single digits in dollars in the first quarter.
 Garner-Denver branded products were flat, and Ingersoll-Rand branded product was down high single digits.
 But when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies.
 As Garner-Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines, while Ingus
 took care on high horsepower compressors.
 This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the view.
 We see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect
 channels that both companies have.
 Our tools and Lyft, which is part of this segment, had a very tough quarter with orders
 and revenue down both over 20%.
 The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases
 that online retailers typically make in the first quarter
 to support
 first half of the year revenue.
 However, this quarter, in addition to the slowdown of the market, many online retailers
 switch their focus to household essentials.
 Moving to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, ITNS delivered $135 million in the quarter, which
 which was down 25%.
 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, which was down 150 basis points when the

 This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands
 that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets.
 In the first quarter, we saw orders growth, high single digits in the legacy medical pump business.
 as we are a leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators, and liquid handling.
 You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page.
 Our teams have been working 24-7, providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future.
 The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance, down 2% X effects,
 with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China,
 and towards the end of the quarter in India.
 What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions
 due to the niche applications in water and chemicals,
 which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in the more industrial end markets.
 Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, PNST delivered $53 million in the quarter, which is down 6%.
 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points, driven by a strong cost

 controls, and productivity, leading to decremental margins of only 15%.
 Slide 17, and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment, our priorities for this segment are
 to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner.
 We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments.
 and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward.
 Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter.
 Adjusted orders were $213 million, and adjusted revenue was $185 million, up 8% and 7% respectively, with a book-to-bill of 1.15.
 growth was driven by the strength
 in gold, connectivity and consumer product lines.
 The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February, but
 the pandemic hit the U.S. we saw sharp decline in the second half of March but
 There is a lot to be excited about.
 We're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons.
 First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter
 where some product was shifted
 to the second quarter of 2019.
 And two, the business is not immune to this current environment.
 While April orders were down year-over-year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders.
 We feel this is driven by a couple of factors.
 First, in the consumer product line, the team pivoted quickly to leveraging demand generation
 techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses, and we have seen better momentum
 recently in the run rate.
 And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations,
 We were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed.
 Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, specialty vehicles deliver $18 million in a quarter, down 1%.
 Loan GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth, investments, and product mix.
 Moving to slide 18 and the high-pressure solution segment.
 The business performs above our expectations in a tough operating environment with adjusted
 orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million, down 26% and 29% respectively.

 in the business
 was nearly 90% up the market
 and the team executed very well commercially
 with sequential adjusted orders up 6%
 and sequential adjusted revenues up 26%
 versus the fourth quarter of 2019.
 team.
 We continue to see share gain opportunities in aftermarket, and specifically consumables where we saw orders and revenue up double-digit sequentially.
 This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24 million and margins of 24.6%,
 which was down from last year's level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points.
 As we pivot to the second quarter and the rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity.
 We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market.
 As a reminder, each frag fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks.
 with each truck carrying one pump.
 Each pump has a fluid end, and every fluid end utilizes consumables.
 For Q1 of 2020, on average, we saw 318 active fleets.
 the exit rate in March was

 to see a substantial drop in the second quarter

 with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil.
 impactful impact on revenues within this segment.
 And because of that, we're taking very proactive time
 to drive the proper cost takeout
 to still show reasonable profitability
 in the quarter to come.
 Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of proof.
 Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders.
 as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets.
 by the order of momentum throughout April,
 We expect total revenue to be low.
 In terms of orders, both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments
 were right in line with the total company average.
 Well, precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive
 year-over-year orders performance thus far.
 as a result of continuous strength
 in medical pumps.
 And not surprisingly, the high-pressure solution segment is down as the market resets for what
 will likely be a prolonged downturn
 that we expect will last for a number of quarters.

 As we look forward...
 If we look forward, due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in, we will not be
 providing Q2 or total year to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right
 steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated
 impact on cash flows.
 A current model shows that the business will

 using fairly conservative assumptions
 around working capital and capets.
 coupled with the cost actions we have taken thus far.
 We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position.
 Turning to slide 20 for some concluding remarks, I want to say that what we
 manage through what we will
 no doubt be a tough second
 quarter. We feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has

 And we continue to pay attention to the particularly under current conditions to be strategic on bolt-on acquisition.
 With this, we will turn to the Q&A.
 At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question,
 number one on your telephone
 keypad. If you would like
 to remove yourself from the queue,
 you may press the pound yourself to one question and what your first question comes from andy kapalitz
 from Citigroup. Your line is open.
 Good morning, guys.
 How are you?
 Good morning, Andy. Good to you.
 Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order declines you're seeing
 in your largest segment in IT&S?
 First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that PowerTools business now have, you know,
 smaller up
 So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses, given they're
 more project versus the industrial compressor business.
 Uh, yeah, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color.
 But, I mean, as you saw, we said roughly, you know, April total orders down 20%, book-to-bill greater than one.
 From a book-to-build perspective, you know, the industrial technology and the precision
 and science were greater than one and obviously leading the way.
 I'll say, you know, in terms of ITS in particular, you know,
 So I will categorize it as, you know, the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter
 and continue to see, you know, some relatively weakness here moving forward.
 I mean, it's mostly correlated to, I guess, maybe the PMI.
 you know from
 the down and the mainstream which is
 what we consider to be more
 on the loan cycle, I'll say, you know,
 Comparatively, a bit more stable in the first quarter, and we kind of continue to see maybe
 some of that in the month of April.
 Again, typically, we tend to get the orders for that loan cycle now in the first half
 of the year in order to get shipments in the second half, and from a PTL, from a power
 two perspective
 Yeah, I mean, rough quarter in Q1, as I alluded.
 I mean, last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into
 online retailers, and you saw that in the first quarter, many of these online retailers,
 they moved to having other kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19.
 and clearly, you know, this business
 saw some of the impact
 I'll say April's sale is relatively slow, so we haven't seen the pivot of the momentum
 of the PowerTool business.
 So that's helpful, Vicente, and I'm sure you expected us to ask about decremental margin in some way.
 so let me just ask it like this
 some obviously, you know, good result in Q1 of close to 30.
 You know, how do I think about decrementals with high-pressure solutions, you know, the orders down 80 percent?
 Can you hold decrementals there in the mid-40s?
 At what point, you know, does fixed cost become a problem?
 I know you talked about accelerating the rest of the business.
 Can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business?
 Yeah, so I'll say, Andy, I mean, that's kind of what we're targeting for.
 And, I mean, as you have seen, you know, we have performed well in the down cycles in the past.
 I think we have a good solid playbook
 that we executed in the 15-16
 that included both not only in the industrial
 downturn, but also an upstream downturn, you know, base documentals, they tend to be
 around 40%
 across the business
 with slightly higher
 in businesses like
 the high pressure
 as you mentioned, as well as the precision and science
 because of the nice high gross margins that those businesses have.
 And, you know, lower on the specialty vehicles.
 And the industrial technologies, they tend to play in that kind of
 40% range, you know, you've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies
 and the short-term actions to protect the margin.
 We saw, as you've mentioned, you know, some very good first quarter results for the total
 business under 30%
 And Q2 will clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective, but we will continue
 to manage the decrementals with the target being
 closer to that 30%
 of the imita
 And, you know, when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive
 actions and the high pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot
 of our data points and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have.
 Very helpful, Vicente.
 Stay well.
 Thank you.
 You too, Andy.
 Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.
 Your line is open.
 Hi, good morning.
 Good morning, Julia.
 morning, maybe just a
 first question on that point on
 decremental margins
 so if you could help us understand
 and perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year
 and also of that $40 million to $50 million of other cost-out actions?
 And should those mean that decremental margins narrow
 or not necessarily depending.
 or mix and some other things.
 maybe break it down into the two buckets
 as you suggested, and the 40 to 50 that we spoke about,
 that are kind of more related to discretionary
 or kind of volume related.
 Those are largely second quarter and the third quarter, with a good majority, I would say,
 more so on the second quarter.
 from a
 The cost synergy perspective, $1 million, you know, out of the $80 to $90 million of in-year, you know, roughly account.
 and I would say that it's kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter,
 While the other roughly 10 to 20 million dollars that comes from procurement, it is really
 more weighted towards that kind of Q3 and Q4.
 And then maybe just my second question for you
 or for Emily around the free cash flow.
 She had a good performance in Q1.
 And just wondered, you know, you have assumptions around break-even free cash.
 but assume
 play out
 you know what kind of
 You know, if sales are down, call it 20%, 25% for the year.
 what's like the free cash flow conversion
 should we expect
 you know, how do you see
 You work in capital moving.
 you had I think
 in the free cash
 That's $63 million of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1.
 what's the rough
 assumption for the year.
 Yeah, we're very pleased with the Q1 cash performance, as you saw there, Julian.
 and we've been managing
 cash
 you know, from
 to put in good processes and strong controls around it.
 given the current
 crisis
 We expect cash to still be – to move forward, but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through what's going on.
 And we're really managing, you know,
 payments as
 the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and
 liquidity positions.
 You know, what the future holds, a lot of that's, you know, going to depend on for sure,
 but we know we maintain our cash position and our liquidity.
 And how about the costs?
 Yeah, any very rough guideposts for the year in light of that 63 million in Q1?
 There'll be some incremental
 I don't have the
 I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment, Julian, but I can get back to you on that.
 Your next question comes from Michael Holloran from Baird.
 Good morning, everyone.
 I hope everyone's doing well.
 So could we just talk about the Synergy Funnel you referenced?
 What are some of the incremental sources that you originally identified 250?
 maybe talk about the difference you're seeing, you know,
 longer term, some of the revenue synergy opportunities you see.
 As you recall, you know, we always said that we were going for, you know,
 Because we, with 60 days into the transaction, we have all this visibility as to what that
 That funnel could potentially be roughly the $100 million comes from a combination of structural
 savings
 rationalization
 kind of non-manufactured
 I alluded to on the investor's call.
 We have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world, and that is
 giving us a very good way for us to really understand
 and rationalize not so much
 coming year two, year three
 but more
 the other kind of perspective.
 Okay.
 So, so, um,
 The second part of the question, liquidity is in a strong position.
 and, you know, some of the one-off things, just preparation, you know, and some of the extra things.
 Emily just referenced.
 What would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash outs, though?
 And then secondary related to that, that we're going into some sort of recession here.
 who knows how long this opportunity is going to accelerate through the play
 capital more towards the M&A side of things over the next couple of years.
 and are you positioned for that today
 and any kind of thoughts on how you're thinking about that capital side over the next six, nine-plus months?
 Yeah, no, absolutely, Mike.
 I mean, I think, you know, clearly over the next couple years, continue to be a really part of our strategy.
 you know we see it's a very unique environment right now
 we still see at this point in time some very good funnel on also very good funnel
 around, you know,
 industrial technologies, but they're really more related towards both homes.
 Thank you.
 Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolf Research.
 Your line is open.
 Good morning.
 How are you guys?
 Good night, Coach.
 Good, Ian.
 Yeah, good, thanks.
 social tech performance
 So a little bit.
 of former
 performance, and it seems like most of that
 It came from the legacy IR businesses.
 can you maybe just kind of
 I'll spell out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the jugs of the industrial, of the iron.
 Also, what happens with service during the quarter?
 Glad you were happy to work.
 Yeah, what happened to –
 I would say this.
 Yeah.
 I think, I mean, China was definitely impacted largely in January and February.
 the legacy IR business
 They have a pretty sizable China exposure.
 you know, in terms of
 the service, you know,
 We saw service better.
 typically we saw
 roughly about two times
 from a percentage perspective, better performance than the original equipment.
 And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here, particularly, you know,
 ways of comparing some of the, you know, industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies,
 It's compressors, vacuums, and blowers.
 And our compressor business is clearly within the...
 When we specifically compare to some of the first couple of data points that we look at
 of the third-party report.
 At the same time, you know, just to give you a further perspective,
 of the legacy Gardner Denver business in Q1,
 orders were down in the low single
 in the market
 And, you know, since we didn't own the legacy IR for the full quarter,
 we just tend to not comment on
 what we saw specifically, you know,
 January and February that they
 so from an order perspective.
 But that hopefully gives you a good perspective
 about too high
 even on the
 LegacyGD.
 Great. Thanks.
 Thanks, Mr. Zaday.
 this doesn't
 become so
 small now
 it's so much
 development but
 if it is done
 80% in the quarter.
 That implies, you know,
 I mean, is it possible to break – given you're clearly expecting this business
 to be kind of like weaker for longer,
 would you expect
 revenue
 is kind of
 like just bounce
 going to the trough here.
 for the next several quarters.
 I mean, any color that would be helpful.
 Yeah, so for sure, you know, that's what we're targeting to be, you know, the breakeven and even positive.
 I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions, 100% aftermarket and consumable.
 So that kind of carries a much better margin profile, too, as well.
 And, you know, those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume,
 I mean, we're basically keeping them close or very, very low exposure.
 So it's a good playbook on how to navigate.
 have done extensive work, and, you know, I think we see that we can definitely overcome
 this kind of long term
 Our plan is that it's going to be down for a while.
 And to the second question, you know, I mean, clearly it's a market that, as you saw, we just invested in new fluid and technology.
 and, you know, we can be ready for capturing.
 Great.
 Thank you very much.
 Our next question comes from Jeff Sprott from Vertical Research Partners.
 Thank you.
 Good morning, everyone.
 Why don't we just come back to service for a moment.
 This is an interesting comment about utilization down from 30%.
 But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward rate where sales are going to be down 30% into service?
 I just don't believe.
 I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together,
 but what does that down 30% tell you?
 Yeah, Jeff, great question.
 So in terms of the historical data, we don't have a lot of historical, because as you can
 imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the IoT platforms that
 we both companies have now is fairly new, but we have enough data to then break it down
 by the specific sub-end market.
 The indication here is that it's telling us where are those markets that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective.
 So it's helping us to redirect the teams.
 It is also helping us to really better serve our customers
 and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective.
 You know, in terms of being down 30%, I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication
 as to what could happen here, but as you gave us a great correlation,
 we don't have a lot of historical data to
 So what we're doing is just taking that data point and focusing them on those areas, regions, and markets
 that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors.
 And in the answer to that, you noted IPS obviously includes more than compressors.
 tax. Are you suggesting
 that those other products there
 areas outside of vacuum, fumes and blowers were substantial.
 Yeah, so for sure, yes, I mean, for sure the power tool and the lifting business was one that it was worse than that.
 I mean, the power tools, they have two main product lines.
 I mean, it's that tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization.
 So I think, you know, that was impacted more so.
 and then China as a region
 was definitely heavily
 impacted
 and you know
 from the other product lines
 in terms of the longer cycle, which these are kind of brands
 like Nash, Gero, liquid green pumps and liquid green vacuums, those are more longer cycle
 and those were, I'll say, more stable and resilient.
 Great. Thank you.
 Your next question comes from David Rosso from Evercore ISI.
 Your line is open.
 Good morning.
 My question is about in the ITS inventory in the channel,
 and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen,
 Can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement, sort of a lead lag?
 and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle.
 Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels, the lag you would need to see
 or that you would experience if, say, the PMIs got better, for example?
 Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, when we look at the inventory in those channels, I mean, there's just nothing like this from a compressor perspective,
 which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network.
 And it is also more particularly towards the Gartner-Denver branded products.
 We don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors,
 sub-regionalized, more localized.
 They don't tend to put a lot of cash in there, but they don't tend to be more sub-regionalized,
 up front to have compressors on the shelf so to speak I mean maybe on the
 smaller compressors they may
 but not on the medium to high level
 compressors
 And the inventory will come in more on consumables, aftermarket, and really move fairly well.
 I mean, they turn fairly quickly.
 you've seen just home clear
 Is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS?
 ITS, or have you seen some, you know, little improvement in order sequentially?
 and I'd be curious
 Is that more short cycle or long cycle?
 Yeah, no, yeah, great question.
 And it is outcategorized as the stabilization.
 initially and then obviously
 when you look at it within the month
 I mean, at the month of April, you know, there's some slight improvement on the second half of April.
 But again, was that more short cycle improvement?
 Sure cycle, yeah.
 I look forward to the move.
 Yeah.
 Sure cycle.
 All right.
 Thank you very much.
 Appreciate it.
 Sure.
 Your next question comes from Josh Pokalinski.
 is open.
 Hi, good morning, y'all.
 Good morning, Josh.
 So, Vicente, I guess, you know, everyone here on the call kind of has the same list of questions.
 and so we covered a lot of ground already.
 But I guess, you know, just with some of the commentary around utilization
 and with the comments you made
 around supply chain interruption,
 How much of the decline that you're seeing, and, you know, I guess this comment is mostly an IT&S comment,
 is related to, you know, customer shutdowns or supply chain interruption in some form.
 I'm like, you know, the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back.
 because I think to some of these points on, you know,
 service or utilization
 that maybe that's not the steady state of the world there.
 Yeah, Josh, I'll say more so in China, if you want to think about it, kind of that disruption completely.
 also in the first quarter
 There may be some disruption from the perspective of in Europe, particularly in Italy.
 I mean we do have some very good
 manufacturing
 days
 in Italy
 and we
 although we stayed operationally.
 I mean, most of our suppliers had to shut down.
 So I would say that now, as kind of the comment that I made before, we see kind of this lower
 demand level kind of getting more stabilized, but, you know, still, you know, not seeing
 that kind of recovery
 and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out.
 Okay, and then switching over to the Synergy funnel,
 I mean, it sounds like the year three, you know, pipeline of activity, you know,
 kind of has to stay there as you have to act on other things first and it's more manufacturing
 centric
 It's fair to say that the incremental step-up in Synergy then into year two is smaller, I guess, you know,
 Is this more of a pull forward from year two, or are you kind of implicitly saying,
 hey, we think there's more than 250 here, we're just, you know, we're working on this
 as fast as we can, and we'll update you as we know more.
 Yeah, I mean, I think that's exactly the case.
 we think
 We think we want to keep it at $2.50 just because we think it's prudent.
 and we think it's brilliant because we're
 I mean, clearly focus on a lot of the internal funnel and execution.
 you see how we accelerated
 it, and we execute it.
 I mean, this is not just talking about be executed, but there's a component around procurement
 plan.
 and an I2B savings innovative value that is volume dependent.
 And when we did the $250 million cross-energy funnel, it was done based on 2019 kind of
 run rate levels, so to speak, or spend levels.
 So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase.
 you know, once we're ready, we'll definitely
 and when we see kind of more stability or normalization in the markets,
 Maybe we come back with that.
 But at this point in time, we're accelerating what we can control.
 And we know that we can control that structural headcount out, and that's exactly what we executed.
 We know we can control a lot of the quickings in procurement
 because commodities are lower, and we are executing that.
 and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spam,
 and that's exactly what we also executed.
 So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute.
 Great.
 Appreciate the color.
 Good luck to you.
 Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stiefel.
 Your line is open.
 Good morning, everyone.
 What do you think?
 You know, revenue down 8.6 to XFX,
 margins up 120
 on a 20 basis plan.
 Clearly some very good control there
 on what drove the very good
 decrementals there, how you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any
 color you can give us on what you think the long
 term margin
 and opportunities in that business.
 Okay, Nathan, this is, you know, I'll say some very good cost controls, but also some
 very good momentum that we had also from the medical business.
 If you remember last year when we talked about the medical business, we were seeing upwards
 with 200 business points margin improvement
 and the medical business finishing last year
 at roughly, you know, 30%, 31% EBITDA margin.
 So, again, very good momentum from that business, and clearly as we saw some stuff in the market,
 the team continue to execute those targets that they needed to get done.
 You know, I think when you look at this business that, I mean,
 It has some very nice gross margins, and, you know, the base decrementals are typically, you know, 45 or so.
 I mean, pretty good job that the team did here in order to get that decremental down to the 15%.
 percent.
 And I'll say, you know, from a long-term perspective, we'll definitely come back with giving some kind of medium to long-term perspective.
 I'll just do a quick comparison and you can see that medical we were able to, you know,
 not only, you know, just a few years ago that medical business wasn't the 25, 26 percent
 EBITDA margin, and we finished, you know, last year in the 31% EBITDA margin, and there's
 So just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, you know,
 PFAs and ARO business that are within
 this segment
 Okay, maybe just one on receivables.
 when you look through that
 Do you see any customer credit risk, any collection risk there?
 I guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way that market's going.
 but anywhere else you see, you know,
 any potential issues in receivables,
 how you're going about managing customer credit,
 those kinds of things?
 I mean, I'll say not necessarily.
 I mean, I think it's one that we live by, day by day.
 I mean clearly the
 on the,
 high-pressure solution, which is, as you
 mentioned, the most exposed.
 I mean, customers are still paying.
 It takes longer to pay, but they still pay.
 You know, they also realize that, you know, from an upstream perspective that our business
 is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again.
 So we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payments
 or we will stop shipments and then we cease to provide any type of output of products
 either now or later in the future.
 So I think we're really executing a good playbook here on collections with the teams.
 Excellent.
 Thank you.
 Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlaze from Deutsche Bank.
 Your line is open.
 Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys.
 Good morning, Nicole.
 So a lot of this has been answered.
 We've covered a lot of ground so far.
 But I just wanted to ask one.
 into next year as we think about, you know,
 approaching a recovery.
 There's clearly a lot of moving pieces here.
 We've got, you know, more structural cost savings coming through.
 And presumably, you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business.
 and then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins.
 I'm not sure, you know, how best you can do this this end day,
 But it would be really, you know, helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out, you know, on the other side of this downturn.
 Yeah, I know.
 Oh, yeah, that's great.
 I mean, I think, you know, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level
 of incremental to be, you know, for the total business, between 35% to 40%.
 Again, you know, when you look at precision and science, maybe higher than that, specialty
 vehicles lower than that
 with maybe industrial technologies about that level.
 So, you know, definitely we'll see a little bit of a headwind
 as we see a lot of these structural activities
 that we're going to come to the provision.
 we also see a lot of
 you know,
 tellwinds, I'm sorry,
 We see tailwinds that a lot of these kind of structural costs come out.
 We see some of the headwinds, but, you know, as we kind of get closer to coming out here
 to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams, we'll definitely find ways on how
 we can continue to get that
 incremental margin obviously
 to be at a minimum
 I'm not that
 days or more.
 Okay.
 Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse.
 Your line is open.
 So your next question is from Marcus Nittenmeyer from UBS.
 Your line is open.
 Yeah, hi, good morning, everybody.
 I just want to make one more on the – hi, good morning – on Synergy.
 I do appreciate that, obviously, procurement is volume-dependent,
 dependent, but you flagged here 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020.
 what do you currently assume
 a sort of full run rate savings out of that
 wave one of the spend, which I think is a third of your overall spend,
 and how should we think about more medium term for the other two-thirds
 if you assume that at some point in a normalized word,
 to get back to about 2019 levels, let's start here.
 Yeah, I think if you think about it, 10 to 20, you know, coming in this year, as you go into 2021, assuming maybe kind of current volume levels, it will be 20 to 40 million.
 so that's maybe at least
 what you can see here coming from Wave 1 on an analyzed level at current volumes.
 And that is only covering, you know, a portion of the total span with Wave 2 and Wave 3 coming up here in the second half of the year.
 Right, and if there's sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at 19 volume levels,
 that sort of, you know, 20 to 40.
 All right.
 I mean, it will definitely be a little bit higher than that.
 I mean, I wouldn't, you know, I think at this point in time,
 You could say, you know, 40 to 50 could be, upwards of 60.
 Okay, okay.
 And then second question on capital allocation.
 You flagged in the slides with a lot of interesting sort of bolt-ons in PST.
 It's obviously pretty fragmented, Mark.
 you probably have a share of
 call it 15% in that
 space
 How do you think about this?
 How does that segment look like in a few years?
 I mean, it's, you know, from an aftermarket perspective, I know it's a design win-and-replacement business,
 So the aftermarket dollars per se or share is relatively small compared to your company average.
 but how do you think about it
 it just struck me that it was
 slide specifically in the slide.
 Yeah, I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that these businesses are kind of so niche
 and very solid market positions, and it has just a load of great descriptors,
 such as, you know, kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps
 that are kind of really solidly mission critical
 in the processes where they apply.
 You know, we continue to see that there's a lot of potential, not only inorganic but
 also organically and we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take
 technologies like the ARO and combine that with the
 with like a
 either Haskell branded product
 or a Milton Roy product, and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications
 and then enter some new markets.
 And that's what a lot of the team are doing is, you know, how do we are being thoughtful
 and mindful on some of those
 vertical markets and kind of
 new niche adjacent areas
 that we want to play in, and not only do that organically, but then see what other technologies
 from a Bolton perspective, we can acquire.
 So a lot of really great work strategically going on in this segment to really picture
 this and how do we kind of double it.
 Thanks a lot.
 Good luck.
 Thank you.
 Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse.
 Your line is open.
 Hi. Good morning. Sorry about that. I had some technical difficulties earlier.
 I'm glad to hear
 everyone's doing well
 So, you know, maybe just one question here.
 You alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both the legacy GDI and IR businesses.
 is I wanted to know
 if you could put a little more color around what's driving those.
 Is there something on the product side?
 Is it, you know, some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around, you know,
 more niche markets like paper
 and pulp
 maybe some
 competitive pressures from
 smaller guys
 It's just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful.
 Sure, Johnny.
 Yeah, so I'm not categorizing.
 I mean, what I said on the call is that it is on specific horsepowers, and what we saw
 that we liked is that this is in the U.S.
 based on the third-party report.
 And we liked it because it was very complimentary.
 If you look at the legacy Garner Denver, we saw some share takes in the low to medium
 horsepower while we saw
 The Ingersoll ran some shared take on the high, kind of larger horsepower compressors.
 I will categorize that as, you know,
 Ingersoll Rang has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the larger horsepower.
 well as you know
 you know, from a Gartner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium to small
 compressor and I think
 this is what I mentioned on the call
 that this is a great hypothesis that we had
 on this great merge
 and combining the two companies
 because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies
 that a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated,
 which is a very good solid kind of core product line.
 But as we spoke about during the April call, now also the oil-free product line spectrum.
 So, again, it's new technology, new products, and be able to show that uniqueness of differentiation
 and the product that the teams are launching.
 Great. I appreciate you taking the question.
 thank you
 There are no further questions at this time.
 I turn the call back over to the company.
 thank you
 I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone
 for your interest in Ingersoll Rand.
 I want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are obviously doing
 a lot of work here to stay health, stay self-safety, and at the same time, you know, provide
 to our customers emission critical products that are needed in this kind of current market
 condition.
 so hopefully everyone
 stay safe.
 and healthy, and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks.
 Thank you.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
 Thank you for participating.
 You may now disconnect.

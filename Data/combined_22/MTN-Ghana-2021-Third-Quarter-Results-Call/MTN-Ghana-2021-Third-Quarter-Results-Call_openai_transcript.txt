Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to MTN Ghana's 2021 Q3 Results Conference Call. All attendees will be listened only mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions when prompted. If you should need assistance during the call, please signal an operator by pressing star and then zero. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now turn the conference over to Mr. Jeremiah Opoku. Please go ahead, sir. Thanks, Judith, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss MTN Ghana's third quarter performance for the period ended 30th September 2021. I'm Jeremiah Opoku, Investor Relations Manager for MTN Ghana. With me on the call today are Stella Madadivo, CEO of MTN Ghana, Antoinette Kofi, our new CFO, who joined MTN on 1st October, Elie Hene, CEO of Mobile Money Limited, Kofnabentiencho, our General Manager of MTN Ghana Finance, and Tatu Motalande from Group Executive for Investor Relations. So Stella will share an overview of our performance for the third quarter and outlook for the rest of the year before we move on to the Q&A session, which will be facilitated by the conference call operator. The call is scheduled for an hour, and if there are any more questions, we may allow a five-minute extra time. I'll now hand over the call to Stella. Thank you. Thank you, Jeremiah, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making the time to join us on this call today. On the call, we'll discuss our third quarter performance, and I'll also touch briefly on our expectations for the rest of the year before we move on to Q&A. In Q3 2021, we maintained the momentum from our half-year performance, underpinned by our diligent execution on Ambition 2025, investments in network and IT systems, and ensuring our people remain a priority in light of the continued effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 26 October 2021, the official Ghana Statistics on COVID-19 showed a rise in the total infections and deaths to 103,823, respectively. MTN Ghana continues to extend support to cherished customers through our Yellow Hope initiatives, including the zero rating of all mobile money P2P transfers up to a value of 100 Ghana cities a day, and we're also running the One More Push campaign to encourage everyone to wear a mask and get vaccinated. We at MTN continue to adhere strictly to all COVID-19 protocols with the aim of safeguarding the health and safety of our people and of our customers, and we also remain committed to Ghanaians and the environment in support of the continued fight against COVID-19. Turning to operational performance for the period, we recorded a 25.4 year-on-year growth in service revenue, driven mainly by data and mobile money. We continue to deliver on our infrastructure modernization plan and implemented CapEx-related infrastructure projects to expand 4G capacity, 4G coverage, and to improve the quality of service for our customers. Over the period, we invested a total CapEx of approximately 1.060 billion Ghana cities, which includes the rollout of 959 4G sites, the modernization of 1,543 existing 4G sites, and this helped expand our 4G population coverage by 4.7 percentage points to 84.7%. We grew our active subscriber base by 0.4 million quarter-on-quarter to 25.2 million, and this reversed the decline in the last quarter that we experienced. This was supported by our network investments, digital offerings, and an improvement in quality of service overall. Looking at the various business segments, we recorded a 51.9% year-on-year growth in data, driven by increases in our active data subscribers and total data consumed within the period. The contribution of data to service revenue expanded from 29% to 35.1%. Voice revenue recorded a single-digit growth of 2% year-on-year. The growth in voice continues to be impacted by shifts in customer behavior towards data and implementation of S&P directives. The contribution of voice to service revenue declined from 42.5% to 34.6% year-on-year. We expect the trend in the voice segment to continue as a result of continued growth in smartphone penetration and the preference for data services by consumers. However, we expect data growth to compensate for the slower growth in voice. Mobile money revenue increased by 45.3% year-on-year, supported by increased active users, higher P2P transactional activity, and growth in advanced services such as retail, merchant payments, microloans, insurance, and international remittances. The contribution of mobile money to service revenue increased from 19.6% to 22.8% year-on-year. We recorded a 23.8% year-on-year decline in digital revenue, which was a result of the continued impact from the application of the principal versus agent accounting standard across the MTN group in 2020. On a normalized basis, digital revenue increased by 14.4% year-on-year, supported by growth in our active digital subscribers. Reported EBITDA increased by 27.5% year-on-year, with a margin expansion of 1.1 percentage points to 54.4%. This was supported by our continued focus and execution of our expense efficiency program. Profit after tax growth for the period was 34.0% year-on-year. And as announced last quarter, we paid the interim dividend of 0.03 Ghana Cedis per share, totaling an amount of 369 million Ghana Cedis. And this payment happened on 14th of September 2021. Looking at the regulatory landscape, the National Communications Authority, the NCA, through the telecom operators, is embarking on a six-month nationwide SIM re-registration exercise using the Ghana national ID card as a sole card for this purpose. This exercise will run from October 1st, 2021 to 31st March 2022. MTN has begun this exercise and remains committed to support the government to register all existing and new subscribers on our network. As announced in the previous quarter release, MTN Ghana implemented the directive from the NCA on phase one of the on-net, off-net price differential removal on default tariffs for voice, data, and SMS from 1st of August 2021. Phase two is scheduled to be implemented on November 1st, 2021 to extend beyond the default tariffs to cover promotional offers and special offers. Including the above remedy, we have implemented all three of the seven S&P remedies defined to date by the regulator. We will update the market on the implementation of the remaining four directives as discussions with the NCA progresses. Now turning to our outlook, we expect to maintain the business momentum through the last quarter of the year. We will continue to expand 4G coverage and improve our network to further enhance subscriber growth and customer experience. In addition, we will progress the execution of the expense efficiency program and our prudent approach to managing costs to deliver on our commitment of margin expansion. We will continue to support our employees, our customers, and communities as we deliver against our Ambition 2025 focus areas for the year in order to capture long-term growth opportunities and create sustainable value for all our stakeholders. I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers and I look forward to interacting with you over the next one hour. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time if you would like to ask a question, you're welcome to press star and then one on your touchtone phone to keep that on your screen. If you decide to withdraw your question, you're welcome to press star and then two to exit the question queue. Just a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to press star and then one. The first question comes from Jonathan Kennedy Good of JP Morgan. Good afternoon. Thanks for the opportunity to ask questions. First one is on selling distribution and marketing expenses. I just wanted to check whether it looked like I think there was 24, 25% growth in that fairly large OPEX line. Just trying to understand whether there were any one-offs there or it was due mainly to the pandemic base of last year and trying to get a handle on what we should expect growth to be like in that expense line going forward. And then on the implementation of phase two of the regulation on on-net, off-net pricing, how do you expect that to impact voice revenue? Would it be substantial pressure on the voice line or could growth be maintained? Okay, thank you for your questions. Let me start off with the first one, which is the distribution and marketing expense line. So this is really an anomaly for this year. This year is our 25th anniversary and as part of our 25th anniversary, we've had various programs which have shifted our expenditure, I guess, patterns. So that spike you see or that anomaly you see in Q3 is as a result of the 25th anniversary. This should normalize through, so no major concerns there. In terms of phase two of the S&P on-net, off-net, I believe the last time we spoke,

In terms of phase two of the SMP on net off net, I believe the last time we spoke I shared our estimate at the time to be about 1% impact on total revenue. The current implementation we're undergoing may increase that number slightly, maybe somewhere around 1.2 to 1.5% in terms of the total SMP impact on that. But until we've implemented it and seen what the trends are, it will be a bit difficult to be very specific. We're here assuming things around how customers will react in terms of elasticity and all of that. But I'm fairly confident we should land somewhere in that range for the SMP on net off net as far as the expectations are. Jonathan, does that conclude your questions? Yes, it does. Thank you. Thank you very much. The next question comes from Prashant Ranjan Odaya of NetBank. Hi, good afternoon everyone. Congratulations on your results and thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions. Sorry, I've got four, I hope they're not too long. First one is around the new SIM registration procedures. Would that pose any challenges to meet the March 2022 deadline? And are there any subscribers at risk that you guys know about? And linked to that, what would be the revenue impact if those subscribers had to be disconnected? Secondly is I noticed you reiterated your timeline to have the localization of 25% of the telco and 30% of the mobile money business by the end of the year. Can you just give us an update on your progress to date? I think the last time we spoke there was the employee share scheme that helped on the localization of the sell down. I think there was only about 8% to 10% that still needed to be done for the telco. So just an update on that and also what progress you've made on the mobile localization would be much appreciated. The last two is I noticed you're still also zero rating your P2P transfers under 100 Ghana CDs. What is the revenue impact of this? The last time we spoke, which was at interim, it was roughly around 6 million Ghana CDs per month. So how has that transpired with the increase in mobile subs? And the last one is how much, I mean, if you can tell us how much of your 45% increase in mobile revenue would be attributable from integrating Momo into the MTN Ayoba during the period. I know there was some integration in there that seemed quite positive. So, I mean, is there anything that could be attributable from that integration in your mobile revenue? Thanks very much. Sorry, if you could just repeat that last question. It wasn't too clear. Sure, sure. So I believe you integrated Momo into the MTN Ayoba platform during the period. So how much of your 45% increase in Momo revenue could you, if possible, attribute to that integration? Okay, gotcha. All right. So let me start with that one. To be honest, Ayoba is still quite young and we've seen quite some interesting behaviors. But at this point, I think any revenue attribution will be a little premature. So that amount is quite low. So we can ignore that for purposes of materiality at this point. The whole essence is to build a behavior and at some point we'll see a lot more significance around that behavior. The second question, let me start from the top in terms of SIM registration. The first question was on SIM registration and whether there's risk on the March 2022 deadline. Absolutely there is. There is risk. This is a major undertaking. And as you can imagine, once this starts, there are a number of key things we have to bear in mind. For starters, the national ID database currently has somewhere between 15 to 16 million registered customers. It's not clear to us how many of that are within each network. But there are plans underway to expand the scope of the registration points to increase those numbers to closer to 20 million, maybe somewhere between 18 to 20 million will be the expected number by the end of March. The second element here is our rate of registration, new registration. There are still some teething issues we're dealing with around how to validate with integrations with the National ID Authority. So we believe all of these will be taken into consideration on the timeline. But at this point, our primary objective is for the base of NIA, which is National ID Card Registered Subscribers. Our objective is to maximize the registrations of our customers within that base as quickly as possible. We've actually declared a few stations that will be doing registrations in areas where we don't have stores and operational centers because it will take too long for people to travel to us. So these are some of the plans we've put in place. This will happen nationwide on a calendar starting from November. We're also investing a little bit more in devices so that we can have as many agents foot on the ground who can go around registering customers and do the validations real time as well. So the number of things we're putting in place to be able to do that. We've already developed some technical solutions as well that will facilitate the faster registration. So there's a lot of work that's going on, but there's absolutely risk. It will be a bit difficult to give numbers at this point because the exercise really just started. But still, there have been some challenges with the integrations, not just for MTN. This is an industry thing. So I'm quite sure once those are resolved, we'll have a better sense of the rate of registration and what the real risk means. But so far, we're definitely ahead in terms of our market share registrations. So we'll continue to put in the focus on that side to minimize the risk on the back end. On the second question, which was on localization and where we are with that. So in terms of Scancom localization, which is up to 25%, I believe the last time we said we're at 17.5%. So that percentage hasn't changed. However, we are at advanced stages in discussions with various elements of the plan to execute that. So I think we are, I mean, there is some risk in getting to the end of the year just about a 25 mark for Scancom. So we are working to the wire on this one. But today we have very good commitment, which will suggest that it's a manageable ambition for us to get to that 25% mark. On the 30% of Scancom, I'm sorry, it's in Momo Money. There is a dependency on getting to 25% on the parent company and then achieving an additional 5%. So the focus there is achieving that additional 5% on the assumption that Scancom achieves the 25%. And we do think that that will be quite a challenging feat at this point. We continue to work with various offers on the table and interests. But the timing will be quite challenging. So again, we're having chats with the central bank on the different options that we have there and we'll update you in that process. But overall, I would say we've made quite some good progress, even though we haven't crossed any major milestone. We're very close to some milestones in the coming weeks. And we look at this process as quite positive from that perspective. The third question was on the free P2P and how much revenue that represented in the quarter. So a total revenue of about $45 million was the free P2P. We assume we are charged for those transactions specifically for the quarter three, only the quarter three. And it's about the same amount. It went from about $35 million to $40 million, quarter one, quarter two, and $45 million in quarter three. Thank you very much. Sorry, Jeremiah, just a quick one. In the first half of the year, it was around $34 million Ghana CDs impact for the whole year. So are you saying in just this one quarter, it was $45 million? Because that's a big jump and it's more than double. So in quarter one, it was $34 million. In quarter two, it was about $40 million. That total is about $73 million. And then in quarter three, it's $45 million. So I think you're having the price mixed up. Yeah, no, okay. Okay, cool. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. You're welcome. Thank you. The next question comes from Jake Ward of Ashmore Group. Hi, Salom. Just have a couple of questions on the active Momo subscriber base. It just appears looking through the quarterly releases that the total active Momo subs has remained a bit unchanged since the back end of 2020, around that 10.5, 10.6 million level. I'm just wondering what you think has caused that slowdown in getting new active subscribers. And perhaps touching on the strategy that you may have in place to address that. And then if you could also just remind us how you, MTN, define an active subscriber here. Okay, thank you very much. So, yes, if you look at the numbers, we've hovered around the 10.5, 10.6 mark for multiple quarters. Just to emphasize that we came out of Q1, we saw a declining trend into Q2, which was the quest concerned in terms of Momo subs. So we saw a 1.9% decline quarter two over quarter one. In terms of quarter three, we've seen a reversal of that trend with about a 1% growth in mobile subs over Q2. Of course, that means we still have some deficit to get to the Q1 levels. But the positive news is that the reversal is happening.

and we have to continue to build off of that foundation. The reasons for the decline in the first place were a number of different things, but the most impactful one was a pilot to implement IDs on cash out. So people requiring IDs to cash out cash from us. This was done in partnership with the central bank, or at least in alignment with the central bank, and there were considerations for cash outs to become a requirement, IDs on cash out to become a requirement for the entire industry. That determination has not as yet been done and we've had discussions with the central bank on the steps forward and no conclusions have arrived at this point. But there is a positive to all of this. We've also seen some impact of all of this in our efforts in trying to minimize and mitigate and fight fraud. So there is that element, which was the initial objective of all of this, was how do we... Okay, so the second component which was seen as a benefit from this activity was the reduction in fraud, or at least the management of fraud. We've seen quite some good improvements as a result of this initiative, plus other initiatives we've put in place. But going forward, Q4, we have a full plan on how to accelerate and be more aggressive on subscriber acquisition and we're executing on that plan. So I'm positive that we'll get through the rest of the year with some positive trends in terms of new and more new subscribers and growth in the total subs for Momo. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up on that, on my last question. Are you able to disclose the number of Momo subscribers who aren't active? Is that very different from the number you report? I can't recall your definition of active. Is it one transaction per month? Yeah, so active is a revenue-generating activity in 30 days, at least one revenue-generating activity in 30 days. Okay, that makes sense. And just one final one, if I may, then, if people are taking advantage of the free P2P at this time, am I correct in saying that they therefore wouldn't show up because it's not a revenue-generating transaction? Oh, no, the fact that you're not charging doesn't make it a non-revenue-generating activity. A P2P is a revenue-generating activity, so they will show up, yes. Okay, very clear. Thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Kudumgura of Kela Securities. Afternoon, guys. Thank you for hosting the call. Just have a few questions. On mobile money, what was your revenue mix over the third quarter for Momo? And then if you could just maybe give us an insight into the volatility around your Momo commissions. I mean, there was quite a substantial growth over the first quarter, second quarter, understandably, as a result of zero-rating, and then suddenly a notable pullback over the third quarter. And then on the data side of things, how many active 4G subscribers are currently on your network, and then how much data was consumed over the nine months? Okay, thank you very much. Let me start off with the mobile commissions because that's quite an intricate one, something that we'll probably spend a few minutes on, and I'll come back to active 4G customers and data consumption. I'll check if I have those numbers here, and then the revenue mix as well. So in terms of the commissions, we've been looking at our commissions trend for a while now, and I think there have been questions here on investor calls on the dilution of a bit of margin. This came up last quarter as well. What we've discovered is that there were some transactions that were manipulated by a set of agents and merchants that are on our network. And through the extensive exercise our revenue assurance team and the mobile team have done, we've been able to put a lid onto those activities. What that has meant is a portion of our commissions which would have been paid out in previous months and will no longer be paid out. And the effect of that started in July. So you would see an improvement in commissions despite continued revenue growth, and that results in margin expansion for the quarter. Okay, so we've been looking at our commissions trend in the last quarter, and we've identified some discrepancies in agent and merchant behavior that has resulted in a significant increase in our commissions overall. Through the work that the revenue assurance team and our mobile team have done, we've put a lid on this behavior and managed to arrest the situation with a number of initiatives that we've put in place. What this has meant, though, is that a portion of our commissions that we had paid out in previous months is no longer being paid up because we've noticed the trend and the undeserved earnings of commissions through this scheme. And as a result of that, we've seen lower commissions in quarter three and a higher EBITDA margin and higher EBITDA numbers for that same period. And we're confident we can maintain this trend going forward and that this trend as it reflects the commission revenue ratio of the business. So we should see a lot more steady EBITDA and commission rates going forward as a percent of revenue. And so that's why you see the changes in commission trend as well as EBITDA trends for Q3. That's the main reason. So I'll pause here to see if there are any specific any other questions on that. Otherwise, I'll go to revenue mix and the other questions that you had. No, I think that answers much of it. Quite amazing that the impact of transactions is that much. I mean, those are some significant increases there. But yeah, please proceed. Yes, no, absolutely. It's quite significant. Okay. The second question was on the revenue mix of mobile money, and I'm guessing it's a split of, you know, what proportion is P2P versus cash out versus others? Correct, yeah. Advances, yeah. Advances of cash and P2P. Okay. So in general, we've seen quite a good growth in advanced services during the period. The percent of total revenue from advanced services is around the 19%, 20% mark. And we're seeing a continued growth in P2P as well in terms of the percent of total revenue around the 45% mark. And then the balance, sorry, around the 35% mark. And then the balance will be from cash outs. So it's roughly 35% P2P, about 20% advanced services, and about 45% cash outs. That's some significant growth in P2P there. Yeah, we continue to see good, if you look at the P2P activity in terms of their P2P, their customer, we're seeing quite healthy growth in those numbers, and the activity continues to be good. Okay, great. That answers that next question. And I guess to the data-related question? I'll have to come back on a data question. Let me just pick up the details. Apologies for that. I guess I've got another question. I noticed that you don't include extra time as part of Momo revenue, and nor do you also include non-core Momo services. Now, what are non-core Momo services, and how much was extra time over the nine months? Okay, so we don't include extra time because it's not, from the definition by our regulator, the central bank, extra time is not classified under mobile money. And, you know, therefore, including it means we're reporting businesses that are not governed by that particular regulator in the reports that we send to them. So that's the main reason we don't do that. Now, in terms of what is non-core, there are a number of partnerships we have, for example, micro-insurance partnerships with IO Holdings, that is non-core, more money revenue. So you can think of extra time and IO revenue as non-core, and the totality of that will be our fintech portfolio. Right, thanks for that. And, Kudret, is there a concluding question? Sorry, on the active 4G subscribers, did you have that number, or I'll have to follow up? Sorry, I'm trying to pull it up. Once I get it, I'll let you know. Okay, all right. Appreciate it. That's all then. Thank you. The next question comes from Andrews Agbaloli of UPSA. Thank you very much. I want to ask a question regarding the share performance on the Ghana Stock Exchange. This year has been remarkably leading the market. I know you don't tell yourselves to be watching the share price while they are on the desk.

starts to be watching the share price while they are on the deck. But perhaps you could be doing something that, you know, in a few words you can tell us what is moving that. Whether that rally can continue into the future. But, you know, within this month or so, we've seen some retreats from the highs of, you know, where it went at 1.24 and then to 1.2. I know, like what I said, if you can give us some tips of, you know, like shareholders, we are interested in the appreciation. Just as we feel that the difference. So if you can give us some hope for what to expect. Thank you very much. Okay. Well, thanks for your question. Let me just sort of start off with, you know, what we control and don't control and the part that we play. And I think the first thing as management is that our role is to deliver on the business performance and to deliver on our commitment to you, our shareholders and our investors. However, we do know and understand that there are other exogenous factors that drive share price and share movement on the stock exchange which are out of our control. So the only commitment I can give is that, you know, we'll continue to deliver on the targets we've set. We already have committed to a modest outperformance of our media targets that we've given you. And, you know, we give you our reassurance that we will continue to perform at that level as far as running the business operationally goes. So from that perspective, I think you can be confident in management's ability to deliver on these numbers and manage the associated risks and challenges that the market presents to us. Thank you very much. Going on to the next question, which comes from Nana Bonana of Axis Pension. Hi. Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question. And congrats on another good performance. So I just want to know management outlook about MUMU in the light of the potential launch of central bank digital currency, i.e. the ECD. I mean, do you see the ECD complementing and deepening MUMU acceptance or perhaps competing with MUMU? Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question and, you know, very good question, something we are very interested in and watching as well. You know, at this point, I won't be able to give you too much detail on our position, but I think, you know, first of all, the objectives of the ECD and what the central bank is trying to do are definitely laudable. We see ourselves as a partner to continuing to digitize currency within the country, and we do believe that we have a role to play. However, since this is a pilot from the central bank, the definition of how ECD will manifest itself beyond the pilot is still unclear, and the role that the existing digital services will play is also still unclear. But we continue to work very closely with the central bank. And at a point when, you know, some of these definitions start to tease out, we'll be able to share. And our view, though, is that, you know, more money has established a behavior within the marketplace, and there's a lot of equity we can bring to a partnership to make ECD successful. So we see ourselves as a credible partner to the central bank to further digitize the market using ECD. But we'll give you more details once it's clear. Thank you. The last question, I mean, it's got to do with the structural separation of the MUMU business. I mean, do you see the potential extension in the timeline given by the BOG? Or you think, I mean, you can do it within, I mean, the January 2022 deadline already in place? Thank you. Yes, thanks for the question. Look, I think I was mentioning earlier that we definitely are to the wire here, and we do have, you know, very concrete commitments and, you know, over 25% of the total localization targets. But there's still a gap we have to bridge to get to the 30%, and we're working very hard on that. So, yes, is there some risk? Absolutely. I think, you know, in terms of timing, there's some risk. But in terms of achieving the objective, we're confident we will. So it might just be an issue of a little bit extra time to close everything off. But we're confident we'll get to 25% in the coming months and then also confident that we'll have the full commitment to get to 30%. Perhaps the execution of that extra bit, we need a little bit more time to tidy up. So that's where we are, and that's, you know, what we're working towards. Thanks. Thank you. That should be it for me. Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Smith of 337 Frontier Capital. Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the results. Fantastic. Can I ask a question on market dynamics and market share? Do you guys know what your market share in Momo is currently disclosed at? Can you also talk about maybe competitive pricing in the market to Momo? Are you still gaining market share to Odekash given we're zero-rated P2P across all pricing brackets? And have you given any consideration to changing your pricing structure? Okay. Sorry, the line wasn't too clear. I think you're asking what the competitive dynamics on Momo is considering P2P price tactics. Is that correct? Yes, yes. Sorry. I know my line is not very good, but yeah, that's the question. Okay. So there are a couple of things going on. You know, we do have one operator that has launched free P2P quite aggressively last year and sustained that for quite a long time. In the last few months, we've seen some intensity continuing to promote the free P2P across all networks but also across all value bands, which is a very aggressive promotion. So absolutely, yes. You know, we initially, I think, on the call last time around, we discussed a little bit what some of the effects of that will be at the beginning. We think we've gotten to a point of equilibrium to a large extent because there are other things that we're also doing to try to support our customers and try to create value for our customers and our network. And we'll also continue to expand our own ecosystem and advanced services. You'd see the growth in advanced services today and represents the utility that customers see in the portfolio of services offered on mobile money. And we believe some of these initiatives will continue to be important in giving customers value but also serving the needs that are most important to them. From a landscape perspective, we will continue to monitor. There's not a point where we feel that there's a need for us to do something slightly different and we'll certainly do that. But you'd see some of our promotions have been coming up to the end of the year that are promoting international remittances. Some of these things are all things to create increased value for our customers. So we want to play the game in a more strategic way and not just on the basis of price because that really starts to change the dynamics of competition. So... Yes, thank you. Thank you. The next question comes from Admire Mbalwani of Terra Partners Asset Management. Good afternoon. Thanks for the call. My question is on the SIM registration using the Ghana ID. From your experience, possibly maybe in Nigeria and other countries, how many sort of subscribers do you expect to lose who don't have the proper documentation to be able to re-register? And what would be the impact on the top line? Okay. Look, it's a very difficult question to answer concretely because of the stage we're at in the process. We're right at the beginning of the SIM registration process. And, you know, we've already experienced a few teething challenges with the process itself. These have been ironed out. There's been some progress, but there are still a few things to complete. And so all operators are affected by the feeding challenges that are in place. In terms of what's realistic to the end of March, you know, a lot of that is based on how aggressive operators are, but also how responsive customers are to the demands for them to re-register. We're seeing, you know, quite some good numbers reaching out to us. We've had over 2. something million customers already reach out to us to re-register and have gone through the process. We've had, you know, maybe 10%, 15% failure rates on the re-registration from that base. So there's activity happening, and this is even at a time when there are still some challenges. I guess to answer your question, you know, I guess it's a bit premature to suggest and to, you know, to come up with numbers that may not register. If we look at Nigeria, for example, they had, you know, multiple extensions to SIM registration as a result of, you know, the number of people within the populace who had the national ID. It's a slightly different situation in Ghana here where today you have over 50% of the 30-something million

already with a national ID and the effort to continue to register the balance is ongoing and the national ID authority is expanding branches in all regions so that that activity can take place. So we're in a slightly different place from what happened in Nigeria. I don't think we can directly compare the two situations. The Nigerian base that was registered as a percent of the population when SIM registration started was extremely low compared to the 50% we have in Ghana today. So different dynamics but nonetheless I do acknowledge the risk of losing subscribers at the end of the period and I can assure you that we will do everything and throw everything at this to make sure we minimize the gap between the registered base and the non-registered base to the extent that we can. And we're taking this process very seriously and we've already come up with plans on how to get closer to customers so the effort for customers to re-register is lower because we're reaching out to them and setting up these temporary registration desks that we're moving around the country. So there are a lot of things we're trying to put in place to make this as successful as it can be. Thank you. Thank you so much. My second question is that I may be wrong but I think last year you were still able to grow voice revenues in double digits and you suddenly dropped to about 2%. Is that pointing? What would have happened and does this point to a position where voice revenues will start to decline? Right. So last year we grew voice in single digits and we obviously had quarters where we had double digits, first two quarters of the year and then we saw a change in trend from Q3 into Q4 in single digits. But nonetheless we've seen pressure on voice and there are a number of drivers on the voice trend. The first one is we're seeing a lot more people shift behavior from being voice-centric towards data-centric services. So that's a natural evolution when people get smartphones and start to do more data services. But the second element is some of the initiatives that have been implemented as a result of the significant market power declaration. The first one, the asymmetric at the end of last year and then August 1st, the S&P on and off net parity application that went live on August 1st. All of these have had some pressure on voice but I think the fundamental driver in terms of significance is really the consumer change and the acceleration of smartphone penetration within the network. Currently we're sitting somewhere between 45% and 50% and we've seen this trend reflected in other markets where the penetration gets to these levels where the voice utility starts to go down very fast in favor of data. So given that trend, what sort of EBITDA margins are you forecasting? Because traditionally data and mobile money are lower margin business lines compared to voice. No, data is slightly lower than voice in terms of margin if you have to separate the effects out but we really don't separate it out. More money is actually a high margin product. So we continue to commit to expanded EBITDA margins. I believe we committed to that at the beginning of the year and that commitment is still in place and we believe we'll deliver on that for the end of the year. Okay, thank you. I don't know if there are more questions. Thank you. The next question comes from Farouk Meyer of AllAfrica Partners. Hi guys, thank you very much for the call. I have three questions. First question is just focused on the dynamics between your mobile subscriber numbers, the data subscribers and voice. So we've seen the penetration, the percentage of voice subscribers who also happen to have data and mobiles increase over the last few years but now starting to stall somewhat. So I just wanted to check from your side, is that something that you're tracking? Is there a key KPI, the penetration of data compared to voice? And at the moment it's 47%, for example, data over voice. Is that a kind of very strong limit? And then the focus will turn to squeezing more money out of the existing subscriber base rather than continuing to grow it. That's question one. I'll let you answer it before the other two questions. OK. It's probably worth us taking your numbers offline because we don't have those numbers that you just quoted. I'm not too sure where you're getting those numbers from. But yes, we do look at subscriber penetration across different products. Yes, that's something we look at and look at how we balance our portfolio. But it's not something we have disclosed. So I'm not too sure how you're arriving at that conclusion. But I think it's fair to say that the subscribers are continuing to use voice. A portion of them are starting to use more data, and that's the trend we're seeing. And there are still, you know, if you look at our voice contribution or voice share of total revenue, it's still in the 30% range, which is still very significant. So voice is not any less significant than it was before. But obviously, the year-on-year growth on voice is where we're seeing the decline, so at least the slowdown. So just to clarify, my numbers, all I meant was if you have 11.9 million data subscribers and you have 25 million voice subscribers, so it's just one over the other. That was what I meant. And then just move to that in terms of the consumer journey. Do you normally find that the voice subscriber firstly becomes a data subscriber and then a mobile money subscriber, or it could be in any direction? Someone could have no data but still be doing more money in some way. Yeah, it could really be in any direction. You know, to do data, you need a smartphone for the most part. We do have, you know, data users who do GPRS but to a lesser extent. But to do data in our active numbers, using more than 5 megabyte per second, you're 99% certain to have a smartphone. But you don't need that to be a more money customer. The second thing to note here is our data, our definition of data, active data subscribers, that 11.9 that you quoted, is based on a 30-day active usage, and it's the same for mobile money. But for our total subscriber base, it's based on a 90-day activity. So we're comparing slightly different bases when it comes to the 11.9 and the 25.2. Okay. Your second question is, obviously, there are a number of subscribers for data and mobile money has been relatively slow compared to your previous higher growth, but the revenues are still very strong. So which obviously points towards very higher kind of higher usage from the existing users. How long can this continue to play out, i.e., the existing users are being squeezed for basically more service versus a need to continue growing the subscriber base for data and mobile money, without which you'll see data and mobile money revenues starting to slow down? How much more room do you have just to squeeze the existing users? Okay. Let me put it this way. I mean, if I look at our growth levels for mobile money, today I'll use the numbers of our total subs. We have about 10.6 million customers. So there's still, you know, significant room to grow customers in terms of new customers that come on board, right? Almost doubling that amount in the coming years. But the second dimension is the transactional behavior of these customers, and that's where you're talking about in terms of existing customers. Today, I mean, we're doing something like 6.7 average P2Ps per user per month. And if you take total transactions, it's somewhere in the early teens per user per month. And therefore, from a transactional behavior standpoint, that same number is, you know, upwards of 30 when you look at other markets like Kenya. So existing users have a lot of room to grow in terms of transaction activity, but that wouldn't happen until there is a lot more ecosystem maturity. We've connected a lot more merchants. We have about 200,000. We need to get that number to over a million, 2 million. We need to connect more services in totality. So there are a number of ecosystem opportunities that would allow the existing usage frequency to continue to increase significantly beyond where it is today. So I don't think we're anywhere close to capping that opportunity, but that doesn't take away the recognition that we need to accelerate our active user growth. And that's something we recognize, and this is where we have the plans in place coming out of Q3 into Q4 to find some permanence to drive in acquisition growth on the mobile money side. Okay, that's very clear. And just last question on CapEx. So I saw in the third quarter, I think there's a bit of a pickup in CapEx versus the first half. Could you maybe re-highlight guidance for the year and the medium-term guidance in terms of where you are on the CapEx cycle? Thank you very much. Okay, so typically we deploy a significant portion of our CapEx by the end of Q3, and this year has been a little bit more unique where we have about 20% of our deployment still happening in Q4. Our total CapEx for the year would be somewhere around $210 million, and we are, in terms of commitment, we are pretty much there, 99. something percent commitment on that value. So we're currently just implementing the balance of CapEx, and we should see the rest of the expansions happen through the last quarter, through this quarter. I think the final date of implementation is around third week to fourth week in November.

Any guidance for the coming year on CapEx or coming few years? Yes, I think our absolute CapEx number would be just about the same, maybe about 5% higher, 6% higher, but it's in that same range of 210, I believe it will be somewhere in the 220 to 230 million range. Thank you very much. Thank you. The next question comes from Ali Alassad of Urgent Asset Management. Hi, Salaam. It's Ali's colleague. I'm calling through Ali's line. I have a couple of questions. The first one is, can you just help me understand the calculation behind average transaction per user per month on Momo? So I think in previous calls, you said it was between 5 and 7, but if we just take the total transaction number and divide it by the active user base, it's a very different number. So can you give us some clarity on that calculation? Sure. On previous calls, the 5 to 7 has been specifically average P2P per user per month. So that number is about 6.7 today. So we continue to see growth, but it's about 6.7. Everything else would be the total number of transactions on a unique user basis per user per month. So it would be difficult to use a tool such as to do that calculation, I'm afraid. We would have to have specific scripts to tease out unique customers and unique transactions to do the division. That's why I don't probably re-consent to the numbers we have. Okay. So internally, it's that P2P number that you guys are most focused on? That's correct. That's the one I've been quoting. So the 5 to 7 is on the P2P, average P2P per user per month. Okay, understood. And then my other question as well, sorry, it's again kind of a number question. We see a pretty big difference between the TPV of Momo, the market share that you guys have on a TPV basis, and the market share that's implied by total active users across all mobile money wallets in Ghana. And when we're getting that latter information from the communications authority data, I think they say there's about 18 million active mobile money wallets, whereas the market share you guys have on a TPV basis is kind of mid-90%-ish. So do you have any idea why there's that massive discrepancy? Because obviously it implies there are lots of kind of active wallets out there that aren't really being used much. Do you have any insight? Yeah, no, I think the, well, I believe the metric you've seen from the communications authority is registered wallets, not active wallets. So just double check that because historically when a wallet is registered, it goes into a database and we present those numbers to the regulator. But it doesn't mean there's any activity. There are also legacy registered wallets that were never used and that's in the system. So it's a cumulative number. There's been no cleanup of that. So that number doesn't actually represent the degree of activity, which is why you're seeing these discrepancies. The second thing is also some of the numbers are quoted on a 90-day basis versus a 30-day activity, but I think this is really more the registered users versus the active users. Okay, interesting. Because they say that there's 44 million registered users and 18 million active. So I was just trying to tease out whether that alongside this zero rating at one of your competitors, whether you're kind of seeing anything there, anything on the ground, but it doesn't sound like you are. Let me just invite Ellie to comment on that. He may have more insight on that. Specifically. Thank you, Selom. The first thing is, like Selom said, the data on the Bank of Ghana side or at the industry level is handled on a 90-day basis, whereas we report on a 30-day basis. So there's that difference in data. The second one is it may be the latest data, but I don't have that. The third one is indeed the activity on our side is higher because of the portfolio of services that we do have on our platform for customers in terms of activity. So that also represents a higher activity on this side versus what you find on the platforms for the other providers. So those three specific reasons could also feed into what feedback you have, but we'll try and get the latest data and also provide that as part of our next update. Thank you. Yeah, amazing. That would be great. And then if I could just squeeze in one really quick one as well, please, Selom. Can you just remind us what you guys are doing in terms of lending products? Are you getting much traction there? Anything you can kind of talk about that? Sure, and I'll let Ellie share thoughts on the lending products as well. Ellie, please go ahead. Okay, thank you, Selom. In terms of the lending product, yes, we have seen good traction, but what we've also done is we've tried to improve on the scoring capability so that we can also manage the level of people who default in the loan repayment and improve upon the level of recoveries that we have on that side. But otherwise, we've seen three partners already. Today we work with the SEGO or AFB, we work with EcoBank, and we work with APSA in terms of the partners who support the loan portfolio. I don't know if that addresses your question. Yeah, anything you could say about the size of that product, or is that still kind of confidential? The size? Today I don't have specifics on the daily loan that we give out, but that number keeps improving. We can once again provide that on the next call. Thank you. Okay, great. That's all from me. Thanks, guys. Thank you. The final question comes from Brad Bubitsky of Equinox Partners. Hi. Two quick questions from me. First is what's driving the growth in your other expenses line? And then the second question is I'm curious whether your market share is different between P2P mobile money transactions and I guess P2C or B2C or the value-added services. Yeah, let me address the second question, and I'll have Kobi answer the question on the expenses on the other line, the growth in the other expenses line. So today we don't have market information to be able to give market share by product as you've described it. So it's very difficult to know what the market share by P2P, B2C, P2B is at the moment. So what we'll have is typically what the transacted value share is, which gives a strong indication of what's being transacted on the platform, an indication of the share across the product. So that's maybe a proxy for P2P activity, but it's absolutely not certain. Kobi, do you want to take the question on the expenses line? Okay, I think we've lost Kobi. Maybe we can take that question offline. If you can just reach out to me after the call, I'll be grateful. Thank you. All right. Thank you, guys. Apologies. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was the final question. I'll now hand over back for closing comments. Okay. Thank you, everyone. And apologies for the eight minutes extension. But thank you for making time for today's call. I know there are unanswered questions, so just please reach out to me after the call, and I'll be glad to assist. Thank you, and you may now disconnect from the call. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

 Good morning, everyone. We are beginning our first quarter of this year, a new campaign for Kresud.
 and we are planting
 in very good conditions
 in the region
 similar size of last years
 and we are going to share
 you a little later
 about the four countries
 and the size of plantation.
 we
 have in this year
 we are budgeting
 and we are seeing better prices
 than last year and higher margins
 comparing to last year,
 having some
 bigger input costs
 in some like
 fertilizers much more bigger,
 but Margie
 seems
 comparing this year to last year
 are a little higher
 we related to the
 real estate business so remembering that
 we have three lines of businesses.
 one is the production size
 and the
 yields on the
 production, the second is the
 real estate, and the third, the services in
 agriculture, related to the
 real estate in the first quarter, we have only news in Brazil.
 in this quarter we have no news
 in Argentina and in the rest of the countries
 a lot of cells
 in there and a lot of liquidities
 in Brazil related to the real estate business
 About our segment through IRSA, the urban segment, it's recovering a lot.
 this quarter was all open
 we saw
 the shopping center is open
 the hotels beginning to open
 and shower
 shower
 receiving a lot of the local
 tourism
 so there is a lot of recovery
 and we are going to see very much better numbers in the real estate
 and their occupation
 suffers something
 something
 but comparing to last year numbers
 they are much better.
 Related to the quarter of production, we were driven by the sugarcane activity.
 in here
 that activity gave us
 much better results
 and was mainly explained by the frozen
 that the country received in the winter
 that made a big loss
 in the southern regions of
 Brazil and that
 made an increase, a very important
 increase in the sugar cane prices combined with the oil prices increased.
 So the combination of the two made a big jump in the prices of the ethanol and the sugarcane.
 and in our case
 our plantations
 within regions
 that they were not affected in production
 so that combination made us a big gain
 and in the others a good quarter too
 related to the
 all effect on our balance sheets
 We see a net gain that was mainly explained by this gross profit, financial result and income tax.
 And there is a loss related to the fair value of IRSA.
 the investment properties received lost
 and Matthias will explain later
 about this loss.
 Finally, we had a gain of close to 2 billion pesos attributable to controlling shareholders.
 so this is the main
 explanation of the
 of the quarter. I will introduce
 This is Carlos Luzon.
 Okay, thank you, Alejandro.
 move to the slide number three
 about the expected planetary
 as we can see in the graph
 this fiscal year
 2022 will continue on the top of the ranking for the third years in a row the area we are planting
 now is
 two sunset two thousand two hundred sixty two thousand hectares
 Distributed around the four countries, you can see in the graph, similar to the last year.
 14,000 in Paraguay,
 40,000 in Valeria 2,
 111,000 in Brazil,
 and 123,000 in Argentina.
 About the crop breakdowns, the crops this year remained the same in the last three years,
 46%
 Soybean
 27%
 Corn
 9% sugarcane, 3% wheat, and the others produced 8% for total of the production.
 moving to the next
 Next slide.
 farming activity, and we call it an output.
 in the graph to the left
 about stock
 conceptions, the
 soybeans of the corn and stoats remaining
 globally low
 having soybean
 about 27.7%
 and corn 25.4%.
 In case of the United States, in this graphic shows you that the stocks in the United States are even lower than on the rest of the world.
 having soybean about 7.3% and corn 10, 1% respectively.
 These stock consumptions have a relation about the commodity prices.
 In relation to that, we can see, observes in the graph, how prices previously went up to reaching their tops in June of 2021,
 about soybean 64%
 and corn
 113%.
 However, along the following five months,
 There was a moderate correction in the prices, dropping 17% in soybean and 25% in corn.
 53% is in common.
 Now, the current regional head positions is in prices similar to the budget.
 In soybeans, 56%, and in corn, 51%, and similar prices to the value.
 About climate condition and showing process.
 As shown in the bottom right of the graph,
 the climate condition in Argentina and Brazil
 had a recovery in comparison
 to the dry season of the last year.
 Currently, the forecast marked neutrality as the NINIA moved away.
 Regarding to the current soybean process, in November 2021, the total soybean is 23%, Bolivia 64%, Brazil 40%, and Argentina 2%.
 total in corn is 13%
 Bolivia 99%, Brazil 30%, and Argentina 12%.
 And the last one in wheat, we have 100% of the planting
 because now we are just starting to harvest in Argentina.
 thank you everybody
 when we go to next page
 we can see what happened in the farmland cells
 and these two operational transactions
 were done in Brazil
 none of them was reflected
 on the balance sheet
 because
 that we are going, we are
 put in the transactions
 is the day of
 surpassing some level of payment
 and given possession
 and that was not
 accomplished on the 30th of September
 in the
 none in the two cases
 the two cells are
 in two different regions
 the first one
 Rio de Mayo, but it was done
 in September
 productive area
 that we sold is 2.9 thousand
 hectares that
 we bought for 40 million reais
 and we sold for 130 million Reais in a nominal sale.
 remember that in Brazil
 we sell in installments
 related to
 those bags of soybeans.
 So when we put the gain, we discount that nominal value to the present value,
 and we made the internal rate of return
 is with the present value
 and giving us
 in the first case
 an internal rate of return in realis of 56%
 and in the case of dollars, 40%.
 that was a transaction
 done when we did
 the merge with AgriFirma
 that we merge through
 paying through shares of Brasil Agro
 and in this case
 only
 selling the third of the fund
 we recovered what we paid for the whole farm
 so it was a big gain
 it is a very important gain for the first quarter
 doing this small transaction.
 the second one
 that it was done
 in October 21
 still not recognized
 and probably will be on the
 30th of December, 31th of December
 in here we are selling a productive area of 2.7 thousand hectares
 for a total number of 589 million Reais.
 This is bigger than the first IPO the company did,
 only selling
 2.7
 1,000 hectares.
 So, a small, and look at what is that price per hectare.
 it is depending in a present value
 or nominal value
 30,000 or more
 of 40,000 or more
 realis
 dollars per hectare
 Sorry.
 $40,000 or $30,000
 or more in the present
 or nominal value.
 So give us the reevaluation of the land in Brazil.
 this is a
 transaction that will be
 recognizing two steps
 first step
 it is
 more than half
 2.5 thousand
 1.5 thousand
 sorry, hectares of productive area in the first tranche,
 and the second tranche would be like 1.1 thousand hectares
 in 2024
 so this is a big transaction
 giving us a big gain for this year
 and for the 24-2024-2
 and internal rate of return
 this farm we bought in 2007
 if I don't remember
 incorrectly
 so
 a long story
 giving us
 like 20% in reais
 or 12% in dollars, a big gain.
 and again when we see a farm at
 3% return, we sell it
 and we begin to invest it in another area or another activity.
 so first semester
 or first quarter
 with activity in Brazil
 but still not reflected in our balance sheets.
 we can move now to page number 6
 and we would like to
 every quarter to be mentioned in some of
 what our agriculture services are doing
 here in this page
 we are reflecting the two, FIO
 and AgroFi
 a few
 were crescent
 owns
 50.1%
 and let's see what is the commercialization
 status
 this company became the first of the country by far, commercializing grains,
 inputs
 features and options, services
 So this company that today, this year, surpassed 6.4%,
 and we can see the breakdown of what is our participation
 on the corn, wheat, and soybeans,
 this company became
 by more than two million tons
 bigger than the competitors
 and this is making really a big gain
 the EFG
 EBT evolution, we see that
 we are achieving close to $15 million
 record of the company
 coming
 five, six years ago, close to
 break-even so this company
 is becoming relevant to result
 And to give an idea of this company that has close to zero debt,
 went to the market and raised
 12.3 million dollars
 at a zero interest rate
 through the local capital market in two years period.
 so this will be for
 investment in fixed assets
 and working capital
 but this company is mainly
 employees
 This year is passing more employees than Crescuit.
 FIO is close to 300 employees.
 Cresud Agriculture in Argentina is something like that.
 these companies
 is pure services to farmers
 from the inputs to the exports
 for the commodities and specialties
 This company is growing not only in Argentina,
 beginning its expansion in the region
 going in the inputs
 to the rest of South America
 in the output, it's beginning in Brazil
 through FIO in Brazil
 so this
 companies beginning
 to be very
 relevant to
 our
 strategy.
 And in the other side, in the right, we can see the evolution of Agro-Fi, where Cresuit
 stake is 20%
 AgroFi expanding not only to Argentina, but Uruguay, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Chile, and going to Colombia.
 so growing in revenues
 growing the last year in 87%
 beginning the first transaction of
 farmers in the
 this is the e-commerce
 for the agriculture business
 and this is the leading company in the region
 with annual visits of 31 million
 participants
 with a lot of monthly contacts
 Finishing a capital raise these days, raising more capital to expand its mission.
 So this is becoming the marketplace of the agriculture business.
 so the two growing a lot
 in the whole region
 we are seeing much more results
 of result through these two
 companies
 I will introduce now Mr. Matias Gajbirovsky.
 Thank you Alejandro
 good morning everyone if we move to page 7 we can see
 the different
 performance of our segments in the
 urban side
 through our participation in IRSA.
 Our shopping malls, we are happy that for the first time in the last one year and a half,
 we are running without restrictions
 the
 uh
 All the pandemic restrictions were cleared by the government.
 So now we can run on a normal operation.
 we can see that after the effect of the pandemic
 we have
 an
 occupancy of almost 90%
 If we leave aside the fact of Falabella that left the country, we have 94.3%.
 The occupancy is growing quarter by quarter, so we expect to have better numbers going forward.
 when we see the real sales
 of course when we compare with the previous year
 that the operation was closed, we see
 ridiculous number
 322% above last year
 When we compare with pre-pandemic levels, we see a real decrease of 10.7%.
 And so we hope to see better numbers going forward as well.
 in the case of the offices
 We remain with the same size of the portfolio with 114,000 square meters
 after selling some properties
 and with the inauguration of Catalina's building
 that we did during the
 December last year.
 The occupancy is at levels of 78.9%.
 the average rent per square meter remains stable at levels of $25 per square meter.
 We see that the companies are coming back to the offices with a hybrid modality, but our operations never close in the office portfolio.
 after the closing of the quarter
 we announced
 said, uh, uh,
 a new sale of some floors at the 261 de la Paulera building.
 we sold three floors
 for 32 million dollars
 that we already collected
 all the proceeds
 and we are using that money to reduce the leverage of the company.
 regarding the hotels
 the frontiers of Argentina
 just opened for foreigners
 in November
 so the hotels in the
 in the city of Buenos Aires were really affected by this situation in the
 south of the country since the locals
 are traveling around the country.
 the operation in Shao Shao was
 very good
 and we hope to see
 the recovery in the city of Buenos Aires
 is going forward.
 One important announcement on IRSA's side was the announcement of the merge,
 or the proposal of the merge
 between IRSA commercial properties
 an IRSA that was
 announced in September
 we just call
 for the shareholders meeting
 that will
 take place on the
 December the 22, so
 after this if they are
 if the merge is approved,
 Cresult will reduce the stake in IRSA from 62% to 54%.
 this is because
 we will issue
 shares for minority shareholders of IRSA commercial properties and we will give
 ears as shares
 going to the
 our balance sheet and the results of the quarter in page 9.
 we can see that we are finishing
 with a gain of 2.8 billion pesos
 compared with 11.4 billion pesos last year,
 attributable to our controlling interest is 2 billion pesos against 4.4 billion pesos last year
 We have here several different drivers.
 if we see on the
 left side
 in the Agri Business
 we have
 results that are in line with
 the previous year, we are finishing with an operating income of almost 2.3 billion pesos
 against the same number
 last year
 And we will see more details in the next page
 In the urban business, we are showing a loss of 4.6 billion pesos
 Against an important game
 35.1 billion pesos
 last year this is related
 to the change in the fur value.
 If you see
 in line six
 there you have the
 results that last year
 we posted again
 of 36 billion pesos
 and this year a loss of 6.4 billion pesos.
 This is related to the macroeconomic drivers of Argentina.
 Now, we are valuing our properties basically at dollar terms similar with the previous quarter.
 but when we convert that
 into pesos
 and then compare with inflation.
 Inflation was at levels of 9% during the quarter, and the devaluation of the official exchange rate was only 3%, or the blue-chip swap was 7%.
 So that effect generates losses in pesos term in the balance sheet.
 so we can move to the next page
 thing
 that here we have the breakdown
 of the
 Assisted
 the data by segment, we can see very good results on the agribusiness.
 with
 The main difference with the previous year was the sugar cane line, line four,
 that this is related to better
 prices
 and better production
 so
 also adjusted
 by inflation
 We have a much better game
 that the previous year
 And then in the rest of the lines, we are similar with the previous year.
 The first quarter is not the most relevant quarter for grains, so we will see the results
 going forward
 in the
 cattle, we have the effect of the inflation
 that price is adjusted lower than inflation.
 so we are recognizing a loss here
 But after a quarter, we see an increase in prices.
 so maybe we will
 recover in the following
 in quarter, and the results of FIO, as Alejandro mentioned, that was very good results, so
 So we keep increasing the video of that segment.
 regarding farmland sales
 all the disposals that Alejandro
 mention will be recognized in the balance sheet probably in the next quarter part will be in steps
 but we will see better results
 going forward. In the previous year, we have, again, related to the receivables, some farms
 that we sold are payable at bags of soybeans.
 So last year, because of the increase in prices, we see a recovery in that line,
 and that doesn't happen this quarter.
 regarding the urban segment
 here is more difficult to compare
 we are we are
 we are
 comparing with an operation in the malls
 That was closed during the previous year.
 So here you can see that last year we posted a loss.
 this year we are recovering
 with almost normal operation in terms of revenues,
 we will have some concessions
 but going forward
 that will
 disappear so we are now running
 with a complete normal operation
 In the case of the offices, we see a stable result.
 here we have different
 different drivers
 on increasing
 score meters
 because of the
 La Palvera, and some that will increase because of the disposals of two buildings.
 and the hotels we start to see
 again positive numbers
 and sales and development
 And during the quarter, there was no significant transactions.
 In page 11, we see the...
 The other important effect that we have in the financial statement,
 we have a net financial results
 of 3 billion
 pesos positive against
 a loss last year of 3.9 billion pesos of loss.
 there
 The reason here is basically the effects.
 when we see last year
 we have a real devaluation of 0.4% or a nominal devaluation of 8.1%.
 And this quarter, we have a nominal devaluation of 3.2.
 and appreciation
 in real terms of 5.6%.
 that generate that
 when we value our debt in dollars into pesos,
 we are recognizing
 again that is in the line
 two in the next exchange
 differences
 Finally, in page 12, we have the breakdown and the debt amortization schedule that remains stable compared with the previous quarter.
 What we did during the quarter was to issue around $60 million in the local market through two different transactions.
 one was
 related to the
 Central Bank
 regulation that
 force companies to
 refinance part of the debt
 in order to have access
 to buy dollars
 so we did a transaction
 very successful in July 2021, and then
 in September 21 we
 issue 41.8 million dollars
 to refinance
 Avon that
 expire in December
 at 3.5% interest rate
 that will
 with a maturity in September 2024.
 before.
 last week we also announced
 that related to our bond that expired in December 21,
 the 53.6 million dollars
 We call that bond in advance, so we will cancel this week all the amount
 in order to reduce our exposure to dollars and also to reduce the leverage.
 so with this we finish the formal presentation
 and now we open the line
 to receive your questions.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you. Now is the time for the Q&A session.
 if you have a question
 you can use the chat
 or the bottom label
 race hunt
 We will take the questions in the order we receive them.
 If there is a question, you can use the chat or raise hand.
 If there are no questions, we conclude this presentation
 and we turn back to Mr. Alejandro
 Wellstang, CEO, for his closing remarks.
 Thank you, Santi
 we are beginning
 a very good season
 big size
 regionally
 having
 capital for buying more
 land in the Region 2
 after the capital increases
 that we did last year
 and we are
 growing
 so we think
 that it's a very good momentum for
 agriculture in the region
 prices are in much better
 terms that in the past
 And margins are much higher.
 so we expect a very good season
 and in the combination of real estate
 having closed
 in the first quarter
 two big transactions
 give us a big
 hey
 Okay.
 Really, really very good forecast of the annual result for the agricultural business for the region.
 and in the case of the
 services in the two cases
 in the field
 having the capital
 and the group
 in the case of Agro5
 it's a team of more than 300 employees too
 So we have the challenge of developing that e-commerce on the region.
 So, really, we are very optimistic on the 21-22 numbers.
 so I would like to thank you
 everyone and
 deserving to everyone have a
 very good week. Thank you very much.
 much.

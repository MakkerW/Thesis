 Thank you, Jeremy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making the time to join
 us on this call today. On the call we'll discuss our third quarter performance and I'll also
 touch briefly on our expectations for the rest of the year before we move on to Q&A.
 In Q3 2021, we maintain the momentum

 and ensuring our people remain a priority
 in light of the continued effects
 of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 As of 26th October 2021, the official Ghana statistics on COVID-19 showed a rise in the
 total infections and deaths to 103,823, respectively.

 Turn into operational performance for the period.
 We recorded a 25.4 year-on-year growth in service revenue, driven mainly by data and
 and mobile money.
 We continue to deliver an infrastructure modernization plan and implemented CAPEX-related infrastructure
 projects to expand 4G capacity, 4G coverage, and to improve the quality of service for our customers.
 Over the period, we invested a total capex of approximately 1.060 billion ganasities,
 includes the rollout of 959 4G sites, the modernization of 1,543 existing 4G sites,
 In this health, expand our 4G population coverage by 4.7 percentage points to 84.7%.
 We grew our active subscriber base by 0.4 million quarter on quarter to 25.2 million.
 This reversed the decline in the last quarter that we experienced.
 This was supported by our network investments, digital offerings, and an improvement in quality
 of said is overall.
 Looking at the various business segments,
 We recorded a 51.9% year-on-year growth in data.
 driven by increases in our active data subscribers and total data
 consumed within the period.
 The contribution of data to service revenue expanded from 29% to 35.1%.
 Voice Revenue recorded a single-digit growth of 2% year-on-year.
 This growth in voice continues to be impacted by shifts in customer behavior towards data
 and implementation of SMP directives.
 The contribution of voice to service revenue declined
 from 42.5% to 34.6% year on year.
 We expect the trend in the voice segment to continue as a result of continued growth in
 and smart form penetration.
 and the preference for data services by consumers.
 However, we expect data growth to compensate
 for the slower growth in voice.
 Mobile money revenue increased by 45.3% year-on-year, supported by increased active users.
 higher P2P transactional activity, and growth in advanced services such as retail,
 merchant payments, microloans, insurance, and international remittances.
 The contribution of mobile money to save is a revenue increase from 19.6% to 22.8% year
 year. We recorded a 23.8% year-on-year decline in digital revenue, which was a result of
 of continued impacts from the application of the principal VESA's agent accounting
 standard across the MTN group in 2020. On a normalised basis, digital revenue increased
 by 14.4% year-on-year, supported by growth in our active digital subscribers.
 reported ever that increased by 27.5% year-on-year,
 with a margin expansion of 1.1 percentage point to 54.4 percent.
 And this was supported by our continued focus
 in execution of our expense efficiency program.
 Profit after tax growth for the period was 34.0% year-on-year and that's announced the last quarter
 we paid the interim dividend of 0.03 gunner cities per share and totaling an amount of
 369 million dollar CDs and this payment happened on 14th of September 2021.
 Looking at the regulatory landscape, the National Communications Authority, the NTA, through the telecom operators,
 is embarking on a six-month nationwide SIM re-registration exercise using the Ghana National
 ID card as a Soul card for this purpose.
 This exercise will run from Oktoberfest 2021 to 31st of March 2022.
 M.T.N. has begun this exercise and remains committed to support the government, to register
 all existing and new subscribers on our network.
 As announced in the previous quarter release, MTN is going to implement the directive from
 the NCA on Phase 1 of the On Net Off Net Price Differential Removal on default tariffs for
 Voice.
 and SMS from 1st of August, 2021.
 Phase 2 is scheduled to be implemented on November 1, 2021, to extend beyond the default
 types to cover promotional office and special office.
 In the above remedy, we have implemented all three of the seven SMP remedies defined
 to date by the regulator.
 We will update the market and the implementation of the remaining four directives as discussions
 with the NCA progressives.
 Now it turns into an outlook.
 We expect to maintain the business momentum through the last quarter of the year.
 We will continue to expand 4G coverage and improve our network to further enhance subscriber growth and customer experience.
 In addition, we'll progress the execution of the Expands Efficiency Program, and I'll

 We will continue to support our employees, our customers and communities as we deliver
 against Michigan 2075 focus areas for the year in order to capture long-term growth opportunities
 and creates a standable value for all our stakeholders.
 I will now hand over to the conference call operator for questions and answers and I look
 forward to interact with you for the next one hour. Thank you very much.
 Thank you very much sir.
 at this time if you'd like to ask a question you're welcome to press the
 If you decide to withdraw your question, you welcome to press star 2 to exit the question
 Thank you.
 Just a reminder, if you'd like to ask a question, you're welcome to RISC-STAR and the L1.
 The first question comes from Jonathan Kennedy Goode of Trapey Morgan.
 Good afternoon, thanks for the opportunity to ask questions.
 The first one is on selling distribution and marketing
 expenses I just wanted to check whether you know it looked like I think there
 was 24, 25%.
 growth and that's
 fairly large RPEX line and just trying to understand whether there were any one
 and source there and trying to get a handle on what we should expect growth to be like
 in that expense line going forward.
 And then on implementation of phase two of the regulation on net or net pricing, how do
 Do you expect that to impact voice revenue?
 would it be substantial pressure on the voice line or could growth be maintained?
 Okay, thank you for your questions.
 Let me start off with the first one, which is the distribution and market and expanse line.
 So this is really an anomaly for this year.
 This year is our 25th anniversary and as part of our 25th anniversary we've had various
 programs which have shifted our expenditure, I guess, patterns. So, you know, that spike
 you see all that up, no only you see in Q3s as a result of the 25th anniversary
 This should normalize through, so no major concerns there.
 in terms of phase two of the SMP on net off net.
 I believe the last time we spoke, I shared our estimates
 the time to be about 1% impact on total revenue.
 The current implementation where we're undergoing may increase that number slightly, maybe somewhere
 around a 1.2 to 1.5% in terms of the total S&P impact on that.
 But until we've implemented it and seen what the trends are, it will be a bit difficult to be very specific.
 We're here assuming things around how customers will react in terms of elasticity and all
 But I'm fairly confident we should learn somewhere in that range for the S&P on it or off on it.
 as fast as the expectations are.
 Great. Thank you.
 Jonathan, does that come through to your questions?
 Yes, it does. Thank you. Thank you very much. The next question comes from
 Prashantran Odaya of Netbank.
 All right. Good afternoon, everyone. Congratulations on your results. And thanks for the opportunity to ask some questions. Sorry, I've got four. I hope they're not too long.
 First one is around the Newsome Registration Procedures.
 with that pose any challenges to meet the March 2022 deadline and are there any
 subscribers at risk that you guys know about and and link to that what would be
 the revenue impact if those subscribers had to be disconnected.
 Secondly, I notice you reiterated your timeline to have the localization of 25% of the telco
 and 30% of the mobile money business by the end of the year.
 Can you just give us an update on your progress to date?
 I think the last time we spoke, there was the employee share scheme that helped on the
 the localization of the cell down.
 I think there was only about eight to 10
 that still need it to be done for the telco.
 So, just an update on that and also what progress you've made on the MOMO localization would
 would be much appreciated.
 The last two is, I notice you're still also zero rating your PTP transfers under 100 Ghana
 CDs.
 What is the revenue impact of this?
 The last time we spoke, which is at INSRIM, it was roughly around 6 million Ghana CDs
 a month. So how is that transpired with the increase in mobile subs? And the last one
 is how much, I mean I don't know if you can tell us how much of your 45% increase in
 and more revenue would be a trouble.
 Extributable from integrating MOMO into the IOBA, MTN IOBA during the period.
 I know there was some integration in there that seemed quite positive.
 So, I mean, is there anything that could be attributable from that integration in your
 more revenue.
 Thank you very much.
 Sorry if you can just if you could just repeat that last question it wasn't too clear
 Everything.
 So you're funny. So I believe you integrated Momo into the MTN ioba platform during the p yet
 So how much of your 45% increase in normal revenue could you could you if possible attribute to to that integration?
 Okay, gotcha. All right
 So let me start with that one and to be honest there
 Ayober is still quite, quite young and we've seen, you know, quite some interesting behaviours
 But at this point, I think any revenue attribution will be a little premature, so that amount
 is quite low so we can ignore that for purposes of materiality at this point.
 Your lessons is to build a behavior and at some point we'll see a lot more significance around that behavior.
 The second question, let me start from the top in terms of SIM registration.
 The first question was on SIM registration and whether there's risk on a much
 That's 20-22 deadline.
 Absolutely, there is risk.
 This is a major undertaking, and as you can imagine,
 You know, once this starts, there are a number of key things we have to bear in mind.
 The status, the national ID database currently has somewhere between 15 to 16 million registered
 customers.
 It's unclear to us.
 how many of that, you know, are within each network. But there are plans on the way to
 to expand the scope of the registration points
 to increase those numbers, to close up to 20 million,
 maybe some of between 18 to 20 million will be the expected number by the end of March.
 The second element here is our rate of registration, new registration.
 There are still some teething issues we're dealing with around how to validate and
 with integrations with the national ID authority.
 And so we believe all of these will be taken into consideration on the timeline.
 But at this point, our primary objective
 is for the base of NIA, which is National IED Card Registered Subscribers, our objective
 is to maximize the registrations of our customers
 within that base as quickly as possible.
 We've actually declared a few stations that we'll be doing registrations in areas where
 We don't have stores and operational centers because it would take too long for people to travel to us
 So these are some of the plans we'll put in place.
 will happen nationwide on a calendar starting from November. We're also investing a little
 be more in devices so that we can have as many agents put on the ground who can go around
 unregistered customers and do the validations real time as well.
 So the number of things we're putting in place
 to be able to do that.
 We've already developed some technical solutions as well that will facilitate the faster registration.
 So there's a lot of work that's going on.
 But there's absolutely risk, it would be a bit difficult to give numbers at this point
 because the exercise really just started.
 But so far there have been some challenges with the integrations, not just for MTN, this is an industry thing.
 So, you know, I'm quite sure once those are resolved we'll have a better sense of the rate of registration and what the real risk means
 But so far, we're definitely ahead in terms of our market share registrations, so we'll
 We'll continue to put in the focus on that side to minimize the risk on the back end.
 On the second question, which was on localization and where we are with that.
 So in terms of scancron localization, which is up to 25%, I believe the last time we said
 we're at 17.5%.
 that percentage hasn't changed. However, we are at advanced stages in discussions with
 various elements of the plan to execute that.
 So I think we are, I mean, there is some risk in getting to the end of the year and just
 about the 25 mark for Skanko.
 So we are working to the wire of this one, but today we have very good commitment which
 which will suggest that it's a manageable ambition for us to get to that 25% mark.
 On the 30% discount, I'm sorry, it's immobile money.
 There is a dependency on getting to 25% on the parent company, and that's even an additional
 5%. So the focus there is achieving that additional 5% on the assumption that SCAMCOM
 what she is at 25%.
 And we do think that that will be quite a challenging feat at this point.
 We continue to work with various offers on the table and interests, and for the time
 in will be quite challenging so again we're having chats with the central bank on the
 the different options that we have there
 and would update you in that process.
 but overall I would say you know we've made quite some good progress even though we haven't crossed
 from any major milestone, we're very close to some milestones in the coming weeks.
 And we look at this process as quite positive from that perspective.
 It's fixed.
 The third question was on, you know, the free P2P and how much revenue that represented
 in a quarter and so a total revenue of about 45 million and was the feet
 P2P, if we assume we are charged for those transactions specifically for the quarter
 three, especially only the quarter three, and it's about the same amount it went from about
 35 million to 14 million quarter one quarter two and 45 and quarter three. Thank you very much
 So, Jeremy, just a quick one. In the first half of the year, it was around 34 million
 Ghana CD's impact for the whole year. So you're saying in just this one quarter it was 45 million,
 because that's a big chunk, then it's more than double.
 So in quarter one, it was 34 million.
 In quarter two is about 40 million.
 Yeah, towards the lowest of about 73 million.
 Okay, okay.
 What's at 3 is 45 million, so I think you have your numbers mixed up.
 Yeah, okay, okay, cool.
 Thank you very much, appreciate it.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you.
 This question comes from Jake Ward of Peshmer Group.
 Hi, Salom. Just have a couple of questions on the active MOMO subscriber base.
 It just appears looking through the quarterly releases with the total active memo subs has
 remained a bit unchanged since the back end of 2020 around that 10.6 million level. I'm
 I'm just wondering what you think has caused that slowdown
 in getting new Mac to subscribers.
 then perhaps touching on the strategy that you may have in place to address that.
 And if you could also just remind us how you, at MCN, define and act as a subscriber here.
 Okay, thank you very much.
 So yes, if you look at the numbers, we hovered around a 10.5, 10.6 mark for multiple quarters.
 Let's emphasize that when we came out of Q1, we saw a declining trend into Q2, which
 which was quite concerning in terms of MoMAsaf, so we saw 1.9% decline quarter two over quarter
 In terms of what's a three, we've seen a reversal of that trend with about a 1% growth in mobile
 subs over Q2. Of course that means we're still
 have some deficit to get to the Q1 levels.
 but the positive news is that the reversal is happening
 and we have to continue to build off of that foundation.
 The reasons for the decline of the first place were a number of different things, but the
 most
 The most impactful one was, you know, a pilot to implement IDs on cash-outs, right, so people
 requiring ID to cash out cash for us.
 This was then in partnership with the central bank, or at least in alignment with the central bank,
 and do considerations for cashouts to become a requirement.
 IDs on cash out to become a requirement for the entire industry.
 That determination has not yet been done, and we've had discussions with the Central
 bank on the steps forward and no conclusions have arrived at this point.
 there is a positive to all of this. We've also seen some impact of all of this in our
 efforts in trying to minimize and mitigate and fight fraud and so there is that element
 which was the initial objective of all of this,
 was how do we, okay.
 The second component which was, you know, a benefit from this activity was the reduction
 in the fraud or use the management of fraud.
 We've seen quite some good improvements as a result of this initiative plus other initiatives
 we've put in place.
 But going forward, Q4, we have a full plan on how to accelerate and be more aggressive
 unsubscribe our position and we're executing on that plan. So I'm positive that we'll get
 through the rest of the year and with some positive trends in terms of new new
 below and you subscribe us and growth in a total successful moment. Thank you.
 Interesting.
 quick follow-up on that on my last question.
 and are you able to disclose the number of MoMA subscribers
 who aren't active.
 Is that very different from the number you report?
 can't recall your definition of active.
 is it one transaction per month?
 So activists, revenue generates an activity in 30 days or at least one revenue generated
 activity in 30 days.
 That makes sense.
 and just one final one if I may, then if people are taking advantage of the 3P-2P at this time,
 Am I correct in saying that they therefore wouldn't show up because it's not a revenue generating transaction?
 Oh no, the fact that you're not charging doesn't make it a non-revenue-generating activity.
 And P2P is a revenue-generating activity.
 So they will show up.
 Yes.
 Okay, very good, thank you.
 Thank you.
 Next question comes from Kuda Kudungura of Keola Securities.
 afternoon guys thank you for hosting the call just have a few questions on
 On mobile money, what was your revenue mix over the third quarter for momo?
 And then the, could you just maybe give us an insight into the volatility around your
 There was quite a substantial growth of the first quarter, second quarter, understandably
 as a result of serrating, and then suddenly a notable pullback with a third quarter.
 And then on the data side of things, how many 4Gs active, 4G subscribers are currently
 your network, and then how much data was consumed over the nine months.
 Okay, thank you very much. Let me start off with...
 with the mobile commissions, because that's quite an intricate one.
 that we'll probably spend a few minutes on and I'll come back to you active 4G customers
 and data consumption, I'll check if I have those numbers here, and then the revenue mix
 So in terms of the commissions, you know, we've been looking at our commission's trend,
 And for a while now, I think there have been questions here on investor calls on the dilution
 a bit of a margin. This came up last quarter as well. What we've discovered is that there
 were some transactions that were manipulated by a set of agents and merchants that I'll
 on our network.
 and through the extensive exercise,
 to help with the rest of us.
 Thank you for watching.
 team and the money team have done, we've been able to put a lid onto those activities.
 What that has meant is a portion of our commissions which would have been paid out in previous
 months and will no longer be paid out and the effects of that started in July so you
 You can see an improvement with that thing.
 emissions despite continued revenue growth, and that results in margin expansion for the
 quarter.
 Okay, so we've been looking at our commission's trend in the last quarter, and we've identified
 some discrepancies in agent and merchant behavior that was resulting in a significant increase
 and out commissions of a role.
 I'm through the work that the Revenue Assurance team and our Old Money team have done.
 We've put a lid on this behavior and managed to to arrest the situation with a number of initiatives that we've put in place
 What this has meant, though, is that our commissions, a portion of our commissions that we have
 paid out in previous months and it's no longer being paid out because we've
 noticed the trend and the, I guess, the undeserved earnings of commission through the scheme.
 And as a result of that, we've seen lower commissions in quarter three and the higher
 a bit of margin and a bit of numbers for that same period.
 And we're confident as we can maintain this trend going forward and that this trend reflects
 as I reflect the commission revenue ratio of the business.
 so we should see, you know, a lot more study,
 EBITDA and commission rates going forward as a percent of revenue.
 So that's why you see the changes in ribbon and commission trends as well as other trends
 for Q3.
 the main reason.
 So I'll pause you to see if there's any specific
 Any other questions on that, so I'll go to Revenue Mix and the other questions that you have.
 No, I think that answers much of it.
 quite amazing that they impact the transaction that much, I mean those are some significant
 I think this is it.
 Yeah, please proceed.
 Yes, absolutely, it's quite significant.
 Okay.
 The second question was on the revenue mix of mobile money and I'm guessing it's a split of you know
 You know, what proportion is P2P versus cash out versus others?
 Correctly, advances, yeah.
 The Vance is a cash-up and PTP.
 Okay
 So in general we've seen quite a quite a good growth in advanced services during the period and the sense of total revenue
 revenue from advanced services is around the 19-20% mark, and we're seeing a continued
 growth in P2P as well, in terms of a percent of total revenue, around a 45% mark, and then
 the balance.
 around the 35% mark and then the balance will be from cash-outs so it's in the
 roughly 35%
 P2P, about 20% advanced services, and about 45% cashouts.
 That's some significant growth in P2P.
 We continue to see good, if you look at the P2P activity in terms of the P2P, the customer,
 We've seen quite healthy growth in those numbers and the activity continues to be good.
 Okay, great. That answers that next question.
 And I guess to the data-related questions.
 I'll have to come back when the days are question, let me just pick up the details, apologies for that.
 I guess what we do. I've got another question. I noticed that you don't include extra time as
 as part of MOMO revenue, and NOAA also include non-core MOMO services.
 Now, what are non-combalm services and how much was extra time over the nine months?
 So we don't we don't include extra time because it's not from the definition by our regulator
 the central bank, extra time is not classified under mobile money, and therefore, including
 means we'll be reporting businesses that are not governed by that particular
 Regulator in the reports that we sent to them. So that's the main that's the main reason we don't do that
 Now, in terms of what is known core, there are a number of part-messages we have, for
 For example, micro-insurance partnerships with IO Holdings that is non-core, more money
 revenue. So you can think of extra time and
 IR revenue as non-core and the totality of that will be our fintech portfolio.
 All right. Thanks for that.
 And could it as I complete the questions?
 Um...
 Sorry on the 4g at the 4g subscribers. Did you have that number or is I left to follow up?
 So I'm I'm trying to pull it up once I get it out there, you know, okay. All right. Appreciate it. That's all good
 Thank you. The next question comes from Andrews Doa Agbololi of UPFA.
 Thank you very much.
 I want to ask a question regarding the share performance
 on the Ghana target stage.
 This year has been remarkably leading the market.
 I know you don't tell your staffs to be watching the share price while they are on the back
 But perhaps you could be doing something that, you know,
 in the few ways you can select what is moving that,
 whether that rally can continue in the future.
 But, you know, within this month or two,
 things on retreat from the highs of, you know, where it went that is 1.24 and then to 1.2.
 Aha, I know like what I said, if you have to can give it some cheese or, you know, like
 share with us.
 they are interested in the appreciation just as you paid as a recipient.
 So if you can give us some hope for what you have said,
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 Okay. Well, thanks for your question. Let me just start off with what we control and
 control and the part that we play.
 I think the first thing as management is is that our role is to deliver on the business performance and
 and to deliver our commitments to you, our shareholders, and our investors.
 However, we do know and understand that there are other
 Other exogenous factors that drive share price and share movement of the stock exchange which
 out of our control. So the only commitment I can give is that we'll continue to deliver
 and the targets we've set, we already have committed to a modest over our performance
 of our media targets that we've given you, and, you know, we give you our reassurance
 that we will continue to perform at that level as far as running the business operationally
 goals and so from that perspective I think you can be you can be confident in
 management's ability to deliver on these numbers. And money is there, associated risks and challenges
 that the market presents to us.
 Thank you very much.
 Going on to the next question, which comes from Nana.
 Bonana of Axis Pension.
 Hi
 Thank you very much for the opportunity to ask a question and congrats on another good performance
 So, I just want to know management outlook about MOMO in the light of the potential launch
 of central bank digital currency, i.e. the ECD.
 I mean, you see the ECD complimenting and deepening
 and we will see you in the next video.
 Bye for now.
 Oh, perhaps competing with Mumbo. Thank you.
 Yeah, thanks. Thanks for the question and you know very very good question something. We are very interested in watching as well
 You know, at this point, I'm going to give you too much detail in our position, but I
 I think, first of all, the objectives of the ACD
 and what the central bank is trying to do.
 are definitely laudable.
 We see ourselves as a partner to continuing to digitize currency within the country and
 we do believe that we have a role to play.
 However, since this is a pilot from the central bank,
 The definition of how ECD will manifest itself beyond the pilots are still unclear and the
 The role that the existing digital services will please also still unclear, but we continue
 to work very closely with the central bank.
 And at a point when some of these definitions start to tease out, we'll be able to share.
 Our view, though, is that more money has established a behavior within the marketplace, and there's
 There's a lot of equity we can bring to a partnership to make ECD successful, so we
 see ourselves as a credible partner to the central bank and to further digitize the market
 is an ECD, but we'll give you more details once it's clear.
 I'm not at.
 Thank you guys, maybe the last question, I mean it's got to do with the structure separation
 of the momo business.
 I mean, do you see the potential expansion in the timeline given by the BOG, or you think
 I mean, you can do it within, I mean, the January 2022 deadline for reading, please.
 Thank you.
 Yes, thanks. Thanks for the question. Look, and I think I was mentioning earlier that we definitely
 out to the wire here and we do have you know very concrete commitments and you
 You know, over 25% of the total localization targets, but there's still a gap we have to
 bridge to get to the 30% and we're working very hard on that.
 So yes, is there some risk?
 Absolutely, I think you know in terms of timing there's some risk, but in terms of achieving the objective
 We're confident we will and so you might just be an issue of a little bit extra time to close everything off
 But we're confident we'll get to 25% in the coming months.
 and then also confident that we'll have the full commitment to get to 30%, perhaps the
 the execution of that extra bit.
 We need a little bit more time to tidy up.
 And so that's the way we are, and that's what we're working towards.
 Thank you, that should be it for me.
 Thank you
 The next question comes from Darren Smith of 337 Frontier Capital.
 I would do that afternoon. Good morning.
 Eventually, results can ask the question on market dynamics and market share.
 but you guys know what your market share in Molo is currently exposed at.
 Can you also talk about maybe competitive pricing in the market to normal?
 Are you just losing any market share to Vodacash given, I mean there's zero rate in P2P, it's across all pricing brackets.
 and have you given any consideration to changing your, your price structure?
 Okay, so the line wasn't too clear. I think you're asking what the competitive dynamics on more money is
 is considering P2P price tactics, is that correct?
 correct?
 Yes, yes, I know my line is not very good, but yeah, that's the question.
 So there are a couple of things going on.
 You know, we do have one operator that has launched 3P2P, or launched 3P2P quite aggressively
 and last year and sustained that for, you know, for quite a long time.
 In the last few months, we've seen some intensity continue to promote the FreeP2P across all
 networks but also across all value bands and which is a very aggressive
 So, absolutely yes, you know, we initially, I think on the call last time around, we discussed
 a little bit what some of the effects of that will be at the beginning. We think we've
 cuts into a point of equilibrium to a large extent,
 because the other things that we're also doing
 to try to support our customers
 and trying to create value for our customers on our network.
 And we'll also continue to expand our own ecosystem and advanced services.
 you'd see the growth in advanced services today
 and represents the utility that customers see
 in the portfolio of services worth in our mobile money.
 And we believe some of these initiatives will continue to be important in giving customers
 value, but also seven in needs that are most important to them.
 From a landscape perspective, we will continue to monitor this and at a point where we feel
 that there's a need for us to do something slightly different and we'll certainly do that.
 but you see some of our promotions
 coming up to the end of the year that are promoting international remittances,
 Some of these things are all things to create increased value for our customers.
 want to play the game in a more strategic way, and not just on the basis of price, because
 that
 that really starts to change the dynamics of competition.
 Yeah, thank you.
 Thank you.
 This question comes from Admire Mulvaney of Terra Partners Asset Management.
 Good afternoon.
 Thanks for the call
 My question is on the CMRE registration.
 I'm using the Ghana ID from your experience possibly maybe in Nigeria and other countries
 How many subscribers do you expect to lose,
 to lose, we don't have the proper documentation to be able to re-register.
 and what will be the impact on the top line.
 Okay.
 Look, it's a very difficult question to answer concretely because of the stage we're at in
 the process, we're right at the beginning of the SIM registration process, and, you
 We've already experienced a few teaming challenges with the process itself.
 These are being ironed out. There's been some progress, but there are still a few things to complete.
 and so all operators are affected by the feeding challenges that I face.
 In terms of what's realistic to the end of March, you know, a lot of that is, you know,
 based on how aggressive operators are, but also how responsive customers are to the
 the demands for them to re-register.
 We're seeing quite some good numbers reaching out to us.
 we've had over 2.7 million customers already reach out to us to re-register and I'm going
 through the process, you've had, you know, maybe 10%, 15%
 failure rates on the re-registration from that base.
 So there's activity happening, and this is even at a time when there are still some challenges.
 I guess to answer your question, you know, I guess it's a bit premature to suggest and
 and to, you know, to come up with numbers that may not register.
 Nigeria, for example, and they had multiple extensions to SIM registration as a result
 of, you know, the number of people within the populace who had the national ID.
 It's a slightly different situation in Ghana here where today you have over 50 percent
 of the 30-something million already with a national ID and the effort to continue to
 register the balance is ongoing and the national ID authorities ink is
 Expanding branches in all the regions so that that activity can take place. So we're in a slightly different place from what happened in Nigeria
 I don't think we can directly compare in the two situations, and the Nigerian base that
 was registered as a percent of the population when some registration
 It was extremely low compared to the 50% we have in Ghana today.
 So different dynamics, but nonetheless, I do acknowledge the risk of losing subscribers
 at the end of the period, and I can assure you that we will do everything and through
 everything at this to make sure we minimize the gap between the registered
 base and the non-registered base to the extent that we can, and we're taking this
 process very seriously and we've already come up with plans on how to get closer to customers
 So you don't have to, the effort for customers to re-register is lower, and because we're
 reaching out to them and setting up these temporary registration
 that will be moving around the country.
 So there are a lot of things we're trying to put in place to make this as successful as
 it can be.
 Thank you.
 My thank you so much.
 My second question is that, I may be wrong, but I think last year, you were still able to grow
 Waste revenues in double digits and he suddenly dropped to about 2% is that pointing?
 what could have happened and does this point to a position where voice
 the best revenues will start to decline.
 Right, so last year we grew voice in single digits and we obviously had quartets where
 we had double digits.
 first two quarters of the year, and then we saw a change in trend from Q3 into Q4 in single digits.
 But nonetheless, we've seen pressure on boys and their number of drivers on the boys' trend.
 The first one is, we're seeing a lot more people shift to behaviour from being voice
 centric towards data-centric services and so that's a natural evolution when
 people get smart phones and start to do more data services.
 But the second element is some of the initiatives that have been implemented as a result of
 the significant market power declaration. I'm the first one to asymmetric at the end
 of last year, and then August fest, the SMP, on and off net, you know, parity application
 that went live on August 5th.
 All of these have had some pressure on voice, but I think the fundamental driver in terms
 of significance is really the consumer change and the acceleration of smartphone penetration
 within the network.
 I'm currently vested in somewhere between 45% and 50%.
 And we've seen this trend reflected in other markets where
 the penetration gets to these levels where the voice,
 Utility starts to go down very fast in favor of data.
 Okay, so given that trend, what sort of ebda margins are you focusing? Because traditionally data and mobile money are lower
 imagine business lines compared to voice.
 No data is slightly lower than voice in terms of margin if you have to separate the effects out
 But we really don't don't separate it out more money is actually a high margin high margin product. So
 and we continue to commit to expand it if it's a margin.
 a margin. I believe we committed to that at the beginning of the year. That commitment
 in place and we believe we'll deliver on that for the end of the year.
 Okay, thank you. I think I'll join the queue if I have more questions.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Farooq Maya of all Africa partners.
 Hi guys, thank you very much for the call. I have three questions.
 First question is just focused on the dynamics between your
 more and more subscriber numbers, the data, subscribers and voice.
 And so we've seen the penetration, the percentage of voice subscribers
 who also happen to have data and normal, you know,
 increased over the last few years, but now are starting to stall somewhat.
 So just wanted to check and from your side, is that something that you're tracking?
 Is there a key KPI, penetration of data compared to voice and at the moment it's 47% for example
 data over voice, is that a very strong limit, and then the focus will turn to squeezing
 more money out of the existing subscriber base rather than continuing to grow it.
 That's question one. I'll let you answer it before the other two questions.
 okay and it's probably worth us taking your numbers offline because we don't
 have those numbers that you just quoted I'm not I'm not too sure where you're
 get in those numbers from but yes we do look at subscriber penetration across
 different products yes that's something we look at and look at how we balance
 portfolio but it's not something we have disclosed so I'm not too sure how you're
 arriving at that conclusion. But I think it's fair to say that the subscribers are
 continue to use voice, a portion of them are starting to use more data and that's the trend
 And they are still, you know, if you look at our voice contribution or our voice share
 of total revenue, it's still in the 30% range, which is still very significant.
 So, voice is not any less significant than it was before, but obviously the year on the
 growth on voices where we're seeing the decline, so at least a slow down.
 So just to clarify, my name is online mentors.
 if you have 11.9 million data subscribers
 and you have 25 million voice subscribers, there's just one over the other. That was
 what I meant.
 And then just to link to that, in terms of the consumer journey, do you normally find
 that the voice subscriber firstly becomes a data subscriber and then a mobile money subscriber
 or it could be in any direction.
 someone could have no data,
 still be doing more and more in some way.
 Yeah, it could really be in any direction.
 You know what, to do data, you need a smartphone for the most part.
 We do have data users who do GPRS, but to a lesser extent.
 but to do data in our active numbers using more than 5 megabyte per second,
 you're, you know, 99% certain to have a smart phone.
 or you don't need that to be a more money customer.
 The second thing to note here is our data, our definition of data, active data, subscribe
 is that 11.9 that you quoted is based on a 30-day active usage and is the same for
 But for our total subscriber base, it's based on a 90-day activity.
 So we're comparing slightly different bases when it comes to the 11.9 and 25.2.
 Okay.
 The second question is, obviously there are a number of subscribers for data and mobile
 money has been relatively slow compared to your previous higher growth but the revenues
 us through a very strong switch obviously points towards very higher kind of higher
 usage from the existing users.
 How long can the user continue to play out, i.e. the existing users are being squeezed
 for more service versus a need to continue growing the subscriber base for data and mobile
 money without which you see data and revenue data and mobile money revenues
 It's starting to slow down.
 How much more room do you have just to squeeze the existing users?
 Okay, let me, let me put this way.
 I mean, if I look at our growth levels for mobile money,
 Today, I'll use the numbers of our total subs.
 We have a lot of 10.6 million customers, so there's still significant room to grow customers
 in terms of new customers that come on board, right?
 almost doubling that amount in the coming years.
 But the second dimension is the transactional behavior of these customers and that's what you're talking about in terms of existing customers
 Today, I mean, we're doing something like 6.7 average P2P space per user per month.
 If you take total transactions, it's somewhere in the early teens by the use of a month.
 And therefore, there's from a transactional behavior standpoint, that same number is,
 You know upwards of 30 when you look at other markets like Kenya so
 So existing users have a little room to grow in terms of transactional activity, but that
 That wouldn't happen until there's a lot more ecosystem maturity.
 We've connected a lot more merchants,
 we have about 200,000. We need to get that number to over a million, two million. We
 need to connect more services in totality.
 So there are a number of ecosystem opportunities
 that would allow the existing usage
 frequency to continue to increase significantly beyond where it is today.
 So I don't think we're anywhere close to capping that opportunity, but that doesn't take away
 the recognition that we need to accelerate our active user growth.
 and that's something we recognize
 and this is where we have the plans in place.
 and coming out of Q3 into Q4 to find some permanence
 to drive in acquisition growth on the Malomanese side.
 Okay, that's very clear and just last question in Cup X I saw in the third quarter
 I think there's a bit of a pick-up in capex versus the first half, could you maybe re-highlight
 guidance for the year and the medium term guidance in terms of where you are in the
 topic cycle. Thank you very much.
 much.
 Okay, so typically we deploy a significant portion of our capex by the end of Q3 and
 This year has been a little bit more unique where we have about 20% of our deployments
 still happening in Q4. Our total capex for the year would be somewhere around $210 million
 dollars and we are in terms of commitment we are pretty much there 99. something
 percent commitment on that value. So we're currently just implementing the balance of
 and we should see the rest of the expansions happen through the last quarter, through this quarter.
 I think the final date of implementation is around third week to fourth week in November.
 Any guidance for the coming year on Capex or coming few years?
 Yeah, so I think our cupics absolute cupics number would be you're just about the same
 Maybe about 5% higher, to 6% higher, but it's in that same range of 210, I believe,
 will be somewhere in the 220 to 230 million range.
 Thank you very much.
 Thank you.
 The next question comes from Ali Anasar of Urgent Asset Management.
 Hi, Sloan. It's Sam, Ali's colleague. I'm calling through Ali's line. I have a couple of questions.
 The first one is, can you just help me understand the calculation behind average transaction
 per user per month on MOMO.
 So I think in previous calls you said it was between 5 and 7, but if we just take the
 total transaction number and divided by the active user
 It's a very different number.
 So can you give us some power on that calculation?
 Sure.
 On previous calls, the 5 to 7 has been specifically
 the average P2P per user per month.
 So that number is about 6.7 today. So we continue to see growth, but it's about 6.7.
 Everything else would be the total number of transactions on a unique user
 basis per user per month so it will be difficult to use the tools helps to to do
 that calculation, I'm afraid. You would have to have specific scripts to tease out your
 customers and unique transactions to do the division.
 way and I'll probably reconcentrate the numbers we have.
 Okay, so internally it's that P2P number that you guys are most focused on.
 That's correct. Yeah, that's that's the one I've been quoting. So
 The five to seven is on the P2P. Average P2P per user per month.
 Okay understood and then my other question as well. Sorry. It's again a kind of a number question
 We see a pretty big difference between the TPV of MoMo, the market share you guys have on a TPV basis,
 basis and the market share that's implied by total active users across all mobile money
 wallets in Ghana. And when we're getting that lot of information from the communications
 authority data.
 I think they say there's about 18 million active mobile money wallets, whereas the market
 share you guys have on a TBV basis, you know, it's kind of mid-90%-ish.
 Do you have any idea why there's that massive discrepancy?
 It obviously implies there are lots of active wallets out there that aren't really being
 huge much. Do you have any insight?
 I believe that the metric you've seen from the communications authority is registered
 wallets.
 not active work. So just double check that because historically when one of us registered
 It goes into a database and represents those numbers to the regulator.
 but it doesn't mean there's any activity.
 There are also legacy-registered wallets.
 that we never used in the system since the cumulative number there's been no
 clean up over that.
 number doesn't actually represent the degree of activity, which is why you're seeing these
 discrepancies.
 The second thing is also, and some of the numbers are quoted on a 90-day basis versus a 30-day activity,
 but I think this is really more the registered users versus the active users.
 Okay, interesting.
 because they say that there's 44 million registered users and 80 million active.
 So I was just trying to tease out whether that comes alongside the zero rating at one
 your competitors, you know, whether you're kind of seeing anything there, anything on
 the ground, but it doesn't sound like we can buck you up.
 Let me just invite Eli to comment on that. He may have more insight on that specifically.
 Thank you, Salaam. The first thing is, like Salaam said, the data on the bank
 of Ghana side or at the industry level is handled on a 90-day basis, whereas we report
 on a 30-day basis. So there's that difference in data. The second one is it may be the latest data,
 But I don't have that.
 the third one is indeed the activity on our side is higher because of the portfolio of services
 that we do have on our platform for customers in terms of activity.
 So that also represents a higher activity on this side
 versus what you find on the platforms
 for the other providers.
 So those three specific reasons could also
 feeding to what feedback you have.
 but we'll try and get the latest data
 and also provide that as part of our next update.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, amazing, that would be great.
 And then if I could just squeeze in one really quick one as well, please, Salome.
 Can you just remind us what you guys are doing in terms of lending products?
 Are you getting much traction there?
 But anything you can kind of talk about that.
 Sure. I'll have at least share thoughts on lending products as well.
 Elite, please.
 Okay, thank you, Salam.
 In terms of the lending product, yes, we have seen a good traction, but what we've
 also done is we've tried to improve on the scoring capability so that we can also manage
 the level of people who default in the loan repayment and improve upon the level of recoveries
 that we have on that side.
 but otherwise we've seen three partners already
 Today, we work with Schegel or AFB.
 We work with EcoBank and we work with Apsa in terms of the partners who support the loan
 portfolio.
 I don't know if that addresses your question.
 Anything you could say about the size of that product or is that still kind of confidential?
 confidential.
 That's fine. Today I don't have other...
 specific on the daily loan that we give out, but that number keeps improving, which I once
 again provide that on the next call. Thank you.
 Okay, great, that's all from me, thanks guys.
 Thank you.
 The final question comes from Fred Lubitsky of Equinox Partners.
 is.
 Hi. Two quick questions for me.
 First is, what's driving the growth in your other expenses line?
 And then the second question is, I'm curious whether your market share is different between
 P2P mobile money transactions and I guess P2C or B2C or the value-added services.
 Let me address the second question and I'll have Kobe answer the question or the expenses
 I'm there.
 other line, the growth of the other line, other expenses line.
 So today, we don't have market information on pizza, you know, to be able to give market
 share by product as you've described it so it's very difficult to know what the market
 say by P to P, V to C, P to B is at the moment. So what we'll have is typically what the
 the transacted value share is, which gives a strong indication of what's been transacted
 of the platform.
 indication of the share across the product.
 So that's maybe a proxy for PTP activity,
 but it's absolutely not certain.
 Coby is going to take the question on the expenses line.
 Okay, I think we've lost the copy. Maybe we can take that question offline.
 If you can just reach out to me after the call.
 I'll be grateful.
 Thank you. All right. Thank you guys. Apologies
 Thank you.
 Ladies and gentlemen, that was a part of the mission. I'll now hand it back to the closing comments.
 Okay, thank you everyone and apologies for the eight minutes extension
 but thank you for making time for today's call. I know they are unanswered questions,
 So just please reach out to me after the call, and I'll be glad to assist.
 Thank you and you may now disconnect from the call.
 Thank you very much, gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.
 Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines.

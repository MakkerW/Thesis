Before we start the Q&A session, please raise your hand if you have a question. Thank you. Thank you, Andy. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call for the full year of 2019 results. We really appreciate your participation in this call. Ladies and gentlemen, for the full year of 2019, our fixed-broadband business in the home became the engine of growth and continued to demonstrate strong performance. Mobile digital business also showed strong growth on the back of solid data traffic in line with 4G network quality and coverage. In the meantime, the price business experienced a slowdown as we deliberately reduced our exposure on low-margin business and partly due to satellite liquidity. For the full year of 2019, Telkom managed to book a 3.7% year-on-year growth in revenue to Rp135.6 trillion, while EBITDA and net income grew by 9.5% and 3.5% year-on-year respectively. As a result of modest growth in total expense of 1.3%, our EBITDA margin recovered to 47.8%, or 2.6% increase from that of 2018. Cash flows from operating activities reached a historical high of Rp54.9 trillion, or jumped by 20.3% year-on-year. Fixed-broadband business through Indium became the growth driver, continuing its strong performance with revenue grew by 28.1% year-on-year, while in mobile business, Telkom's business grew strongly by 23.1% and successfully compensated legacy business to decline. Ladies and gentlemen, during the full year of 2019, our fixed-broadband Indium posted a remarkable performance. Indium added 2 million new subscribers during the year of 2019 to reach 7 million subscribers. Indium contributed Rp18.3 trillion in revenue, or jumped 28.1% year-on-year. In an effort to generate more revenues, we continue to push add-ons such as upgrade speed, upsell to triple play, mini-packs packages, move-in, and additional set-up box. These add-ons contributed to around 13.6% of total Indium revenue in full year of 2019. In line with the higher economic scale, we successfully improved Indium EBITDA margin from 25.6% in 2018 to 33.9% in 2019, getting closer to global standards. In 2020, we target to add another 700,000 new subscribers, lower than last year due to floods in the beginning of the year and also the COVID-19 pandemic. Ladies and gentlemen, on the mobile side, digital business through focusing on high-quality broadband connectivity and variety of digital services became the main growth engines. Digital business increased significantly by 23.1% to 38.2 trillion, driven by 22.3% increase in data and 29% in digital service. In 2019, digital business accounted for 63.9% of total TelecomShare revenue, increased significantly from 53.0% for the same period a year ago. In the meantime, TelecomShare business continued to decline due to natural transition from legacy to data together with the various OTT services. Overall, TelecomShare financial and business performance in the full year of 2019 recorded revenue, EBITDA, and net income growth of 2.1%, 3.7%, and 1.0% respectively. EBITDA margin improved by 0.9% to 54% amidst declining legacy business. Ladies and gentlemen, we continue our strategy to protect high-value customers by providing services according to their personality. At the same time, we pay a lot more attention to youth market by giving attractive choices through digital channels. We keep investing to certain network quality and coverage to provide the best experience for our customers. We deployed more than 23,000 new VGSs during full year of 2019 over 4G base. By the end of 2019, TelecomShare's own VGS totaled around 212,000 units. 76.3% of which were 3G and 4G to support data traffic that increased by 53.6% year on year. Our enterprise business declined by 11.2% year on year as we intentionally reduced low-margin business and shifted our focus on more profitable services such as data center and cloud and also to circularity of characteristics. In an effort to strengthen data center and cloud business, we are building more than 3,000 rack of data center and the first stage is expected to commence operation in April next year. In the long run, we plan to build another 6,000 rack of data center. Our wholesale international business segment recorded 10.6 trillion in revenue or grew by 5.2% compared to the same period last year. This segment is the enabler for other segments in Telkom Group, in particular for mobile business. Its role is very important and strategic in providing international support, while at the same time also serve external customers with its reflected in Telkom's consolidated result. Wholesale and international business contributed around 7.8% of total consolidated group revenue. In 2019, Telkom Group spent 36.6 trillion of capital expenditure of 27% of revenue, mainly utilized to enhance our mobile and fixed line network infrastructures. In mobile services, CapEx was utilized to further improve 4G network quality and capacity, as well as IT system enhancement. While in fixed line business, CapEx primarily utilized to build fiber-based access and backbone infrastructure to support fixed as well as mobile broadband business. A small portion of CapEx was assigned to other projects such as Tower. The COVID-19 outbreak that we experienced early 2020 has an unimaginable impact on the overall economy, including the telco industry. While we conduct our tactical action to help alleviate the impact of COVID-19 crisis, we anticipate that our performance this year will be quite effective, especially in the pandemic period toward at least the third quarter. Due to high uncertainty caused by the COVID-19, we are still unable to provide any guidance for 2020. Nevertheless, since the end of the first quarter this year, we have been performing strict cost-cutting measures as part of our commitment to maintain profitability. In an effort to maintain network quality and coverage, we plan to spend CapEx of around 25% of revenue in 2020. That is ending my remarks. Thank you. Thank you, Pak Arief. We will now begin the Q&A session. If you have questions, please clearly state your name and your company. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. If you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone and wait for it to be announced. If you wish to cancel your request, please press the pound or hash key. Please note there will be a short pause as the questions are being collated. We thank you for your patience. Your first question comes from the line of Myang Chuen Koh from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question. Hi, good afternoon. So three questions for me. Firstly, can we have an update on the mobile competition that we are seeing year-to-date? You know, have there been any significant change compared to last year? Secondly, it's on your digital service. You talked about obviously that being a very key driver of growth. I'm wondering whether for TelecomCell, are they able to also monetize on some of those services like, let's say, video streaming or mobile financial services? Or are we simply monetizing largely through selling data for that? And then lastly, wondering on EdenD Ho, right? I mean, what is sort of the normalized or longer-term EBITDA margins that we can probably get to? You know, we're seeing obviously very nice increase in margins last year. Thank you. Hi, I'm Rachel, TelecomCell. Just addressing your first question regarding competition. So if referring to year 2019, we see that none of the other competitors in the top three have achieved any significant monetization of data, which is pretty much stable. In terms of the, and also to take note that for additional data revenue, TelecomCell still managed to achieve a significant share of the revenue for data. And pricing-wise, it still remains, it was very competitive in terms of price in 2019, especially towards the end, when we saw one of the top three operators here going into unlimited, which pushed their RPMB extremely low. The question would be then, what's next after the unlimited offering? We also see in terms of competition, increased competition in ex-Java because of the expansion of our competitors' network in the ex-Java, and hence, you know, it's how they will play the prime game to achieve revenue share. In Java itself, we're seeing it pretty stable, and it's something which could be an opportunity for TelecomCell. I hope that has responded to your question on competition. From TelecomCell's point of view, we will continue to focus on renewal, on maintaining competitiveness in our network quality, and also especially in our high-value segment who are very
So we have started to see a few events such as projects getting delayed or even getting canceled. And some clients have also either reduced their spendings or totally churned from some of our services, especially those who are in the adversely impacted industry such as hospitality, transportation, and property. There's also been some payment delay or request to restructure the contract as well as the payment. And also because of the lack of mobility of people given the situation, delivery of the project has also been delayed. We have been unable to determine the quantity of this as this is very dynamic, but admittedly we have seen those things happening in the past couple of months. Got it. Thanks, Pak Hari. And the cost initiatives, cost out initiatives? We've been doing various things from the OMH as well as some of the personnel costs like training, some GNA costs. It is in our strong intention to keep the same kind of EBITDA margin and net income margin within this year as what we had in 2019 for the entire group. Adding to Pak Hari's explanation, I think it's some of the marketing and sales activities with the current condition, we use more digital channels right now compared to before. So for example, non-traditional channels already contributed around 60% of the total activities in the sales. This is also impacted to our cost of marketing and sales. We see this going to be sometime in the future, but it is the trend, although we still also need to manage the traditional channel as we see the traditional also as part of the B2B business in the future. Thank you, Pak. Your next question comes from the line of Colin McHarlou from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question. Thanks for the opportunity. Two questions from me. First of all, just on Indy Home, you mentioned 700,000 target for this year. You also mentioned flooding in I think first quarter was particularly bad. But other than that issue in first quarter, intuitively one would have thought the demand would be quite strong given work from home and homeschooling, etc. So is it a kind of lack of end user demand you're seeing in addition to the flooding or is it sort of difficulty accessing homes because people don't want engineers to come to their home to be connected because they're worried about the virus? A little bit more color on why the net ad numbers are less than a million would be helpful. Second question related to that, if you're only looking at 700,000 net ads, why would your CapEx to sales ratio not fall a bit more? I think it's falling from 27 to 25, you said. Why would it not be falling more? Is it related to the data center build out? If you could give us a bit more color on that, Pak Hari, that would be good. And then third question, just a kind of housekeeping one. The impairment charge of 1.2 trillion, what was the background to that distributor and what is the remaining book value that you have in your accounts? Is it likely that we'll face another impairment on that later? Those are my three questions. Thank you. On Indy Home, yes, Colin, the work from home and learn from home situations have helped quite a bit in terms of increasing our sales volume. But we are anticipating that this will not last forever. Even for the new customers, we are anticipating that likely some of them will either reduce their subscription or totally churn from the new subscription that they just signed up. But you were also right that there's been some, because of the spreading out of the virus, the mobilization of our technicians have somewhat been hampered as well. So we have not been able to operate throughout the country, especially in those we have here, like what we call red zones. So that's for the Indy Home. In terms of CapEx, some other purposes are still there. The new one is, like you mentioned, is the data center one. That would cost us around slightly more than 700 billion rupiah for this year. There will be some more CapEx next year. And also to enhance the CapEx in Telkomsel, particularly 4G, there's also some CapEx we will spend for towers and for the IT enhancement both in Telkomsel as well as in Telkom. For the impairment charge, this is due to the decline of the share price of the company. From more than 900 rupiah in the beginning of 2019 to around 300 rupiah at the end of 2019. So this is purely an accounting treatment that we have to do. But in the company's book itself, the remaining book value still stood around 500 billion rupiah as per end of 2019. We are exploring ways to mitigate potential further risk with regards to this. But the reversing could happen, right? If the share price is strengthened, then we would see some reversing to happen. Adding to the first question on the CapEx, half of the CapEx basically are coming from Telkomsel. We can tell you actually this when we driven by the demand, demand basically a lot increased from year on year. In addition to that one, we need to maintain the quality we provide to our customers for the premium net compared to our competitors. This based on all the aspects of our strategy. That's why we think that our CapEx going to be about the same this year. Because even with the digitalization trend, with regard to this COVID, we need to invest more for the capacity and quality. Got it. Very clear. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Arthur Pineda from Citigroup. Please ask your question. Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Several questions, please. Firstly, on the enterprise segment, what drove the big loss in enterprise in the fourth quarter? So you're basically booking segmental profits until nine months and book the massive loss before Q, even though there was a big jump in revenues. Can we get clarification there? Second question is with Telkomsel, what can be done to address the revenue market share slippage? So if you look at Singtel's recent disclosure, you could see that revenue growth still lagged versus peers. We know that your network is already far better versus everyone else. But what needs to be done so that you can grow alongside market? And last question is housekeeping question. Were there any other one-offs booked for the period? Thank you. Yeah, okay. On Indy Home, yes, Colin, the work from home and learn from home situations have helped quite a bit in terms of increasing our sales volume. But we are anticipating that this will not last forever. Even for the new customers, we are anticipating that likely some of them will either reduce their subscription or totally churn from the new subscription that they just signed up. But you were also right that there's been some, because of the spreading out of the virus, the mobilization of our technicians have somewhat been hampered as well. So we have not been able to operate throughout the country, especially in those we have here like what we call red zones. So that's for the Indy Home. In terms of CapEx, some other purposes are still there. The new one is, like you mentioned, is the data center one that would cost us around slightly more than 700 billion rupiah for this year. There will be some more CapEx next year. And also to enhance the CapEx in Telkomsel, particularly 4G, there's also some CapEx we will spend for towers and for the IT enhancement both in Telkomsel as well as in Telkom.

This is based on all the aspects of our strategy.

But what needs to be done so that you can grow alongside market? And last question is housekeeping question. Were there any other one-offs booked for the period? Thank you. Okay. Pauline, on the first question, impact of COVID and the change of customer behavior. Previously, I already mentioned to you, for example, in mobile, now more people using the modern channel and digital channel, which is around 60% of the total transaction happened in the digital channel. Second, actually, the traditional channel also,
becoming more and more digital in doing their work.

Sorry, I had a question on the regulatory changes, if anything is impending. I'm sorry, earlier the line was unclear, but had you mentioned that there will be like 700,000 net ads on Indie Homes this year? Thank you.
Sorry, you're asking about number of customers or data?
Number of customers, net ads on Indie Homes for this year.
Oh yeah, that's the target of additional new customers in Indie Homes for this year. It is around 700,000.
Okay, last question.
On the regulatory, is there no new regulatory? The last one is about in May, resistance has already been established and implemented. The rest is we are still waiting on the first law, but we still don't have any new update on this one.
I'm not sure whether you're aware that there's a recent change in the corporate tax number, so starting this year it will be 19% for publicly listed companies. That has 50% floating.
All the private companies from 25% of income tax becoming 22% of income tax. I think some incentive that government has given to the companies during this COVID situation.
All right, thank you so much.
Your next question comes from the line of Prem Jura Jangasingan from Macquarie. Please ask your question.
Hi, thank you for the opportunity. Two questions from me, please. First of all, following up on the regulatory question, given what COVID has done to the industry, do you think that there is an increased likelihood of industry consolidation taking place post-COVID or even as soon as 2020? Or do you think there's still too much uncertainty around the spectrum situation to force this? And related to that, do you see the competition facing increased network issues and potentially monetization issues given this COVID pandemic? And what do you think happens next on this front? Thank you.
First, I'm going to answer the number two question, the second one, the policy harmonization. I think with COVID and with the growth of data, a lot of experience by all the operators, we do expect that all the operators already aware that we need some more capacity and quality as well to serve the people in the country. With this, I think with our thinking about monetization, with the profit margin that our competitors already met today, it is supposed to be kind of, I think, rational for them not coming to more, let's say, intense competition in the pricing. It is better to monetize this one. We already see one of the competitors, although they provide the unlimited, but the unlimited based on the situation that customers need to consume the main quota. It means still they're thinking about, I think, monetization. The other one, I know that they start to reduce the unlimited package because with this capacity demand, they need to invest more. I think without justified price, they are not going to make any margin. I think this is supposed to be making a bit more rational thinking on how to monetize our F&B.
And I think the consolidation of both COVID, it is quite difficult to answer the question. It is supposed to be from long, long time ago. We believe that I think maximum four of the operators are going to be better for the industry. The less number of operators becoming healthier in the industry, I think the players are going to be more rational. We still believe this is supposed to be based on business rationality. So whenever it is going to happen, basically we support the industry consolidation because that's going to make the industry healthier. Based on I think consideration that government going to think also about the spectrum allocation.
Has there been any clarity with regards to the spectrum in the consolidation process or is that still the big unknown?
I think still unknown on that one. But if you ask further, when we think about 5G, I think spectrum needed is supposed to be bigger. That can be also another reason for consolidation to happen.
Just to add some other point on top of what just Chris. I think post-COVID the need of the industry become healthier is in the bigger interest of everybody. So it means that there could be consolidation one of them and also can be something like as what I already mentioned is monetizing the network in a better way. So we do expect that all the operators can be more rational in the competition.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone. Your next question comes from the line of Nico Margarounis from Danarexa. Please ask your question.
Good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity. Two questions which arise from some news that surfaced from media. First is about potential monetization of towers and secondly the potential partnership with Netflix. So if you can give us some color on these two topics and whether you believe if adding Netflix into your product portfolio would increase the ARPU. And maybe one more question. We see that data yield for TelecomCell fourth quarter coming down and we heard about single commentary on TelecomCell. Is data yield came down further in first Q2020? And how to connect this with your argument that the competition will moderate going forward this year? Thank you.
Okay, I'll take the tower questions. Yeah, we are not in a hurry to do any monetization in our tower business. I think the way we see this business is somewhat different probably compared to any other operators or any other independent tower providers. So we see it as an important enabler to support our business, particularly our mobile business. Having said that, we are open for any obviously if there's any clear benefit from monetization but not in the near term. But we do realize the importance of tower especially when 5G comes around whereby we need better or more density of towers if we have 5G.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Basically, what are the options for you available? Is that widening your tower portfolio or taking it IPO or yeah, what are the options for towers in front of you? Thank you.
We are basically open for any option. We're not, you know, as of now we're not seriously thinking any particular option and as I said earlier, Panico, we're not really in a hurry to execute anything with regard to tower business monetization anytime soon.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, Panico, the second question is on the Netflix. We are in the middle of discussion with them and so far it's progressing quite well. Mainly the discussion was focusing on two things. One is on the compliance with the regulatory and the second one is the protection of the subscribers. So I believe we are closing the gap between the two and once this is acceptable, we're going to be opening the access to Netflix both in Indie Home and Telecom South.
Also, your question on how is the plan in increasing our ARPU? Yes, actually video like YouTube and many other content is one of the reasons people using data connectivity. Definitely, we need to provide I think good option for our customers in order for them to stay with us and also to increase the consumption of the time and also to make some also profit out of these services. I think many other more besides of the video we have game and etc. and this digital services in order to increase the ARPU that we have.
And your question, the third question about how is the growth is I think statement saying that probably the data can be lower that can be possible.
What we are actually my focus is to increase the productivity of our customer in order to increase the ARPU. As long as we can have that one that way we have the daily package to our customer because we have that one demand on daily people that purchase certain package. In addition to this one is also only applicable for one day, three days and etc. This is going to increase the consumption of our customer. In addition is going to increase our ARPU in total. So we not sacrifice our profitability on this one but more kind of capability to increase and maintain the profitability because some of this capacity already been there.
There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand conference back to Mr. Andy Setiawan for closing remarks. Please continue.
Thank you everyone for participating in today's call and should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly. Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may all disconnect.

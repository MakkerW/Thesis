 just please simply type in your question at any time and press send the company may not be in a position to answer every question it receives during the meeting itself however the company review all questions submitted today and publish responses where it's appropriate to do so these will be available via your investment company dashboard and we'll send you an email when they're ready for your review i'd also like to remind you that this presentation is being recorded as usual before we begin we'd like to submit the following poll and i'm sure the company would be most grateful for your participation and i'd now like to hand over to neil ricketts ceo from viserian good afternoon good evening everybody and thank you mark for the introduction i'm joined today by uh chris who's going to walk us through the uh first half interims the financial details and then uh i'm going to be joined by steve who's going to specifically talk about activities in south korea and uh and what's been going on out there obviously you know as mark said we'll be answering some of the questions as we go through the presentation uh and any live questions that come in we'll do our best to answer but all questions will be answered uh post event so uh chris could you lead us through the uh the interim results please yes of course and good good evening everybody um the uh as as you're aware we published the results uh on monday and i will just very briefly take you through those results uh the the first slide that we're going to look at uh just summarizes those results and the headlines i think most people would have actually seen them uh but uh just just for the sake of those who may not have done um we were pleased to report that the group revenues from continuing operations were up 41 to 3.8 million from 2.7 million the previous period and we refer to continuing operations here because we have classified the revenues that were from the aluminium business that was based in Cheltenham which were announced as being discontinued as a discontinued activity and consequently in these results they're classified as such which means from an accounting perspective we have to structure the income statement slightly differently from that which we've done previously and bring in the net results of those discontinued activities as one line uh hence the reason that referring to uh to continuing operations here um it's worth noting that any relocation or redundancy costs in relation to that move are classified as exceptional and there's a note in the interim statement which which details that uh also the ongoing lease costs at longhope are broadly similar to that at Cheltenham but of course they provide upgraded facilities and space for expansion the revenues that were derived from our graphene activities were up 166 to 0.93 million and in the comparative period last year they were 0.35 million and we'll come on to a little bit more analysis of that later on uh the adjusted lbitda which is this primary measure that we use to to report for the business on continuing operations had reduced by 37 percent so those losses were down by 37 percent to 0.71 million from 1.16 million in the comparative period the reported loss for the business as a whole including the discontinued operations was 3.1 million compared to 4.34 million in the previous period and the loss before tax for continuing operations was 2.96 million again down from 4.3 million in the previous period and at the balance sheet date at 30th september our cash was up to 3.5 million compared to 2.4 million uh the previous period so just a little bit more about the key points for the revenue that increase in revenue of 1.1 million came from two sources uh half a million pounds is from the recovery in the two mature businesses aac and tc and you may recall we now report in two business segments one is mature businesses one is technology businesses and the graphene revenues of 0.9 million uh that reported um come from two sources as well they are derived from the um from product sales 0.3 million comes from product revenues and 0.6 million comes from graphene product development uh agreement being the dstl agreement that we announced back in november uh 2020 uh and it's worth just noting that since um we started work on that development agreement um for product um for dstl uh the uh the total contract was 1.95 million which we announced and the total income that we've recognized to date on that on that project is 0.9 million so there's still a further million pounds to to recognize uh on that particular project if we look at um as the cash flow and balance sheet um and we look at the the burn rate for h1 um the monthly burn rate is roughly 0.4 million uh and that is made up of the net cash that's used in operations of 1.2 million uh the intangibles that we have capitalized uh for g scale primarily 0.9 million and any hp stroke lease repayments we've made of 0.4 million uh that comes to a total of 2.5 so for six months roughly our monthly burn rate is 0.4 million as reported for the first half if you compare that to the the cash and the headroom we've got uh of of 6 million at that same date uh we had report we reported in the balance sheet that we had bank balances of three and a half million we had headroom on our invoice finance facilities that we could draw down if we wish to 0.8 million and we had 1.7 million that was still undrawn from the innovate uk loan which is the total of the 5.5 million less the 3.3 million that we had drawn at the balance sheet date we also have proceeds from lansted which will be coming in um over the next few months um until 2022 um they're obviously dependent upon the share price um the first lansted uh instrument um expires in april 22 and the second one in july 22 um so you know if we're looking at our monthly burn rate of 0.4 million our cash stroke headroom of 6 million further proceeds from the lansted instrument um we can i think we can leave you to draw your own conclusions about the level of funding that we actually have we've also expended 1.1 million in the first period on scale-up equipment which is a significant amount for us and we should also bear in mind that you know the innovate uk is a loan um but that that loan does not start to become repayable until 2024 so we're some time away from having to consider uh the repayments on that particular loan um so that's the that's the sort of the main part of uh of the uh um numbers um so i'll i'll hand you back to neil uh to take you through some other things thanks chris so in terms of operational highlights obviously we announced the uh the investment from uh graphing lab limited in south korea just short of two million pounds that includes also a royalty agreement and the trademark agreement uh that's kind of part of our strategy moving forward which is to have these uh key key kind of uh associations with uh our customers and our suppliers in terms of other things that happened we're now in the process of commissioning the uh spanish assets that's an entire factory that was moved over from spain in this period including all of the machinery the testing equipment which i'll touch on later on when we talk about the expansion at longhope and we've as chris said we've spent 1.1 million pounds on scaling up our processes again something that we'll talk about a little bit later in the presentation in terms of things that have happened on the customer side we're very focused around our textile developments and also our concrete developments and you'll have seen that we've signed agreements with crosslet and across leet should i say uh and also super dry and i was very fortunate to go with the designers and the senior management to the opening of their new store where we talked about the impact of graphene uh on their garments moving forward uh in terms of uh other things that are going on within the business although we're focused on uh the textiles and the construction we also have a number of other agreements in place where we're developing uh through steve's team uh things like uh materials for the packaging industry and uh we're very pleased to be working with some of the largest packaging companies that are out there so it shows that the business has a huge amount of traction now and is moving forward in a very focused way in terms of the post-period highlights uh we obviously secured uh under uh steve's leadership uh a grant with a number of uh key uh partners uh in terms of developing our nanomat technology out of spain into pseudo capacitors uh these are required where we're looking at electrification of transport uh i've already talked about super dry and how we're working with super dry on uh multiple projects uh and um lastly we uh managed to sneak into the interims there a royalty agreement that's been signed with godow who are one of the largest steel manufacturers uh it's not the largest steel manufacturer in brazil who have started up a graphene production um graphene exploitation plan uh to look at replacing their steel business uh and we're working closely with those on a number of projects but the first one which has come out as a royalty agreement is around using our mask predominantly in latin america where unfortunately covid is still um very prevalent i think that's a great um kind of step for the business in terms of uh getting godow on board and working very closely both at the graphene engineering innovation center up at manchester where our some of our graphene development happens but also looking at our global footprint which now includes uh south korea north america europe the uk and also now latin america one of the things that shareholders are asked about during the uh pre-submitted questions was you know what's happening at longhope this is the very latest picture of our innovation center which is being constructed at the moment uh that's about a 10 000 square foot facility and includes a state-of-the-art uh laboratory using some of the equipment that was purchased in spain uh we'll also be doing our own materials testing uh people have asked you know what's the main focus of that well it's really about uh commercial things that customers are not happy being in a more open environment but it's also about uh defense and it's about also looking at the next stages of graphene so making graphene is one thing but then actually taking that graphene and using it in uh applications takes an awful lot of uh expertise and uh an effort and so this in my view will be the way that we take the graphene that's produced in longhope and then feed it into customer applications you know how do we get it into a bigger variety of materials as the the business continues to expand within the longhope facility we've actually moved our graphene production from about a 2 000 square foot footprint up to about an 18 000 square foot footprint and that includes the 17 innovation area where our robot will be based unfortunately there's been a little bit of a delay due to uh supplier issues and uh and getting the machine from uh from europe uh we're still anticipating that we'll have that in place uh and uh we'll be uh commissioning it over the christmas period in the new year uh we already have uh have some work to do uh and we'll be learning how to use that machine developing this brand new technique and if we get time towards the end of this presentation we'll run the full video that we showed last time just to give you an indication of the capability of that machine a long hope we've increased our ink production as chris said so being used in not only our textiles but our construction we use graphene nano platelets also in construction and we've increased the capacity using the spanish assets that's uh in the process of commissioning as i said last time so we've got the first machine set up uh and we're now doing the electrical installation and the control system set up so that we can meet the uk regulations now as well we're increasing the ability for us to be able to test the materials that we're producing and we're looking at a range of standard materials utilizing the graphene reinforcement but we're also you know increasing this research area the slab itself will have a brand new product in it in terms of recycled polypropylene fibers which have been reinforced with graphene as well so this will be a real place to be able to demonstrate and hopefully you know covid permitting we'll be able to uh invite shareholders along to see some of these facilities shareholders are invited in fact any visitor that comes to this site will require an nda and um and obviously we're trying to keep all of our information as confidential as possible so access is really quite limited but um we do hope to hold uh uh some events so that uh shareholders can get to touch and feel the uh the facility and get an idea of how that has expanded as i say from 2000 square foot to almost 28 000 square foot just catch my breath slightly so uh moving on i'm going to pass over now to uh steve steve is down in uh in cambridge and uh has recently been to south korea and he's going to give you an update as to what's been going on in south korea steve can you take over now thanks no and i knew has to everybody that's hello in korean um so as neil mentioned uh just to give a it's almost been one year now since the uh acquisition of assets from hanwa tequin so just to go through the history of where it all started um and so samsung tequin uh back in 2009 they they initiated uh the graphene business uh under their semiconductor parts operation department they worked on uh predominantly three national projects uh one with the uh ministry of uh trade industry and energy moti and others with the msit that's the ministry of science and ict and those amounted to around 24 million pounds and the main goals there were to achieve uh quite large scale growth of single layer graphene uh by via the the chemical vapor deposition cvd approach lots of effort and activity were going towards development of graphene in in different applications particularly those that will rely on on roll-to-roll very high throughput manufacturing so a lot of work has been done on looking at the replacement or substitution of indium tin oxides uh that we we find in most of our displays and devices and so also along along those lines um systems were built capable of producing around 1.6 by 9 uh 90 uh 1.6 meter by 90 centimeter scale uh graphene so that that's uh uh was followed by a takeover by hanwa tequin in 2015 uh who then launched further projects uh with msit and those were looking to develop new equipment for testing and characterizing graphene in a non-destructive way many of the techniques that we have to use for characterizing graphene can be destructive um but obviously there's quite a lot of interest in once we've made large scale samples how how to put those into an application and analyze the quality without destroying those so there's several pieces of inspection equipment which have now been transferred over to verserium career and two of the the previous ongoing projects were then completed during that phase as well between 2015 and 2020 obviously the discussions with hanwa tequin have taken many months uh during 2020 and i'll go through what's been happening since then um so on to the next slide our story didn't didn't start there we we date back to around 2017 where when neil um first went out to japan and korea as part of a megatech trade mission uh that was a uk ti led uh led mission and that was where we first met matt walker uh part of uh dit department of international trade and then in the subsequent years uh in june and september 2018 neil again visited uh korea we're also involved in a innovate uk global business innovation program gbip uh focused on advanced materials and again that led to new collaborations and partnerships in south korea uh in october 2018 we appointed uh rachel kim as our korean representative who's who's uh still with the business and in the in those uh years leading up to the the first discussions myself and matt walker again since he joined the business we we visited to to again build networks build collaborations and and that was all supported by rachel kim so probably uh june last year was was the time where we we started uh we we heard about the opportunity to uh acquire the graphene business from hanwa tequin so obviously there were several months there of uh discussions assessing the ip due diligence and negotiations all or with covid going on in the background and then it was it wasn't until december 2020 that we we finally acquired the the assets and the ip from from hanwa aerospace so that was a busy year last year and and this acquisition uh as as we presented before this this covers more than 100 patents across 29 different families with uh protection in in many parts of the world and that's covering everything from the process equipment uh recipes and and graphene growth recipe uh manufacturing methods obviously before we we even start the graphene growth we need to uh use a metal substrate and also those substrates depending on their cleanliness and the quality and the size of the metallic crystals that really affects the graphene growth so there's lots of know-how and ip based on what we do to that metal before it even goes in the furnace before we even switch on the machines once we actually make the the single layer graphene lots of things you can do after the process because naturally once it's exposed to the environment it's picked up certain molecules it can have what we call doping so it can be p doped or n doped and that might then affect the the final application that you're trying to develop so there's lots of things post-treatment wise you can add certain chemicals to the graphene surface to get electrons to either move move into graphene or move out of graphene so that you can you can start from a clean platform um obviously we're growing on a metal and that the graphene if you want to make a semiconductor device that has to be transferred so one of the key processes is looking at how we can get rid of that metal and so there's a range of both wet chemical processes and also dry processes to get the graphene from the copper or metal onto the substrate of your choice whether that's plastic that's glass or could even be a textile substrate lots of ip there is also on that metal removal and that's that's the chemical process and also looking at um end electronic devices and and so several application ip there that we can we can look to harness um so moving on to the next slide this is really the story of the last year so um month by month once we did that acquisition last december um the first few months were looking for a new facility for all of the equipment and looking for strategic partners out in south korea so that took about three months we were searching uh different provinces in south korea uh looking and making sure that we fit in with all of the local environmental policies um and yeah three months later and following strategic investment from graphene lab uh in in korea we moved into a new facility in may and i'll go on to the next slide where that's based and uh may was the the month where the big move happened moving everything from hanwa to to the new verserian career premises and then subsequent months june july fitting out the labs installing commissioning equipment repairing some parts hiring new staff so we've we've had new technical business development staff join the company and they've moved across from hanwa tequin so they've got all of that know-how and expertise uh that was critical to continuing the business process in august and september we were involved in a korean news program ytn one of the one of their most famous news channels and that was with myself and matt walker taking part from the uk and then probably and quicker than i'd expected we were producing first samples by october so first quite good quality single layer graphene samples and then obviously we we've needed to continue optimizing and and improve that process not just the graphene growth but the transfer processes as well so i visited beginning of november for around 10 days and that was a great opportunity to meet the new staff to look at what progress has been made meets graphene lab obviously as our strategic partner we want to have a very good relationship very strong collaboration and also had the opportunity to go and visit several academic institutes meets other commercial partners that we that we want to work with and also sign some collaboration agreements while i was there we also installed a class 1000 clean room and that basically means we have a very low number of particles of dust and contamination in the room so that will enable us to provide even even high quality graphene materials and then end of november we've even seen our first sales of cvd graphene materials so that's that's a huge step and now we're we're looking to really create high quality data sheets that we can supply to the market and and provide samples to both academic and and commercial partners so here's a map of south korea um so the orange point is is our new location so we're in the gyeonggi province that's just south of the center of seoul we're about one hour south of gangnam uh we're about one and a half hours from incheon airport and about 30 minutes south of where hanwa tequin were formerly based so that's in a in a city called songnam so it's quite convenient location good for getting around korea and and as i say traveling to and from the city center or outer lying areas quite a lot of areas around uh we're based in a place called uh hua song hua song sea and there's lots of other kind of industrial uh cities around around that area so it's a very good location um and probably a one hour in in the south uh city called daijon many many large companies and academic institutes are based in that city as well so we're quite well but well placed uh at the moment so a couple of pictures uh of the the building you may have seen some of these before um and some photos here we've we've posted some of these on twitter unfortunately i can't have videos for you today but uh you may have seen me posting some uh images and videos of machinery being moved from a basement level building up and onto uh onto these large vehicles um and also another piece of kit that required actually shutting down one of the the highways uh in in south korea uh was was the installation of the scrubber so that's that's a piece of equipment which sits outside the building which is taking all of the extracts from our processing cleaning it and then uh emitting cleaner cleaner air so plenty going on um here's a few snapshots from our ytn tv news channel uh with myself as i said uh due to covid we weren't able to travel at that time but we were able to uh to film and this is uh uh mr kwan who's the cto of uh of graphene lab and we have quite quite frequent get-togethers to again discuss collaborations and and discuss what the future holds here's a few pictures of of the clean rooms so i mentioned we've we've recently had a class 1000 uh room installed so the the square room in the background uh we probably won't show you inside that but that's where the graphene is being synthesized and that's where we do some of the other processes called lamination transfer and stacking uh the rest of the room is hosting uh quite a lot of chemical uh testing and graphene characterization so measuring electronic properties measuring things like the the environmental tolerance of of the graphene that's produced uh there's a a room in the back which i'll show a picture of in the second which is another characterization suite and off the page to the right hand side we actually have a a wet chemical etching system system so as i mentioned there's two two routes to to remove copper from the process and that can be through a chemical dissolution and so there's uh different systems here for doing on a batch uh on the the left hand side is a batch scale and on the right hand side is doing more roll-to-roll processing so you can do much larger larger scale higher throughput um um here's a final snapshot of the of the characterization lab so not everything here but just you can see a raman spectrometer on the left we have a scanning electron microscope in the center and that has other uh x-ray characterization capabilities for elemental analysis and things like that so um yeah very well tooled up now with uh tools which also can can help support uh activities in the uk because there's equipment there that we don't have in the uk um here are some of the first samples that we've actually sold um so uh a customer wanting uh four inch squares of uh of graphene on different substrates so we actually we've supplied it with uh what we call a thermal release film so this this means you can transfer the graphene from that copper using a thermal release tape and so it's it's a dry dry process doesn't involve any uh any chemistry but what we also do uh we're growing the graphene as a single atomic uh single layer of atoms but then we can actually stack this up uh and we do that uh stacking these layers one by one because for certain applications you might need a lower sheet resistance so you want something that has a bit more conductivity um and obviously steel is is optically transparent um so we have a lot of expertise in not just the growth but also this this stacking and transfer process which is is crucial to to many of the applications being developed so there's me in the lab with one of our technical guys and uh again one of on the right hand side signing a collaboration agreement with one of our partners sd lab and so that again is uh possibly more focused for uh the uk business but but would involve technology from viserian career uh so sd lab are are developing novel antimicrobial devices and coatings that uh all sit nicely alongside our existing technology developed with uh with nanomats so so that should be a good collaboration and there's further uh potential there to work on different kinds of sensor to detect antimicrobial species um which will go alongside some of some of their intended products so that's really exciting and uh i think one of the questions uh on the on the channel was you know is is career just going to be focusing on cvd graphene and and the answer is no definitely not because uh obviously we want to further establish and push what we're doing in the uk out into into asia um so although probably the focus will be on on manufacturing cvd graphene for sale uh we we need to develop further academic and commercial opportunities and and also we can now support that those cvd activities in the uk europe and and the us and where you know other parts where uh viserian already has a footprint of course key uh key to this is forming that strong relationship with graphene lab uh who are a strategic uh investor and with with with them we're looking to develop commercial sensors and other optoelectronic devices and also work alongside uh potentially some national projects uh that are key to south korea but yeah absolutely looking uh to further extend the nanoplatelets and other products that we're producing in the uk nanine gmp hp materials the gp500 which is uh material produced from the the spanish assets that that neil's talked about hexatine is is still being uh produced and we're looking to develop new applications with with the hexagonal boron nitride the graph inks again a lot of scale up going on in in long hope at the moment and uh i call them gna expert nanomats materials which are quite a wide portfolio at the moment and then of course the product 17 polygreen graphene we're hoping to push these out into south korea as soon as we can so i think that's it for me neil i'll pass back uh to yourself to to finish up yeah just going back to that last slide actually steve we've already started that uh those conversations with our standard range of uh products and processes so um you know that's uh that's something that we're continuing to brief our people on the last slide of the presentation is really about our environmental statement which is you know we believe that this area is in a unique position to deliver you know substantial environmental gains by using the key technologies that we've developed uh if we look at concrete we know that we can uh we could reduce the environmental impact by up to 30 which is obviously very topical at the moment that's not the only thing that this area could affect things like uh light weighting in the automotive and aerospace applications and steve's team still continuing to work on the uh the european graphene um flagship project where we're looking at uh key components for the aerospace industry to change the way they do things a really disruptive technology uh but we're also looking at advanced building materials we're looking at recycling bioplastics uh and so pretty much everything that we're involved in including energy has been that someone talked about in in the questions and answers that have been going on at the moment they all have a massive impact in in the way that uh you know the environment is currently being uh you know looked at so very topical uh that concludes the the kind of presentation but we've got some questions here and uh be interesting to go through some of the questions um that's great now let me just give you a small pause so you can uh break between the q a so uh thank you to you all for for your uh for your presentation ladies gentlemen please do continue to submit your questions using the q a tab on the right hand corner of your screen but just wanted the guys take a few moments to review the investor questions submitted during today's meeting i'd like to remind you that recording of this presentation along with a copy of the slides and the published q a can be accessed via your dashboard on the investor meet company platform i'd also like to remind you that your feedback will be important to the company and immediately after this presentation's ended you'll be redirected in order that you can provide the company with your thoughts of views and expectations um neil not a lot of time to look at those questions but i guess you've had a bit of time throughout the presentation if i may can i just hand back to you to read out the questions where you think uh it's appropriate to give responses to and uh obviously as you previously mentioned that uh the q a that was pre-submitted obviously that you'll have a chance to review that and put some responses to that as well so if i may just hand back to you just to read out the questions that'd be great thank you very much mark we've tried to answer as many of the pre-submitted ones as we can as as we go through the presentation but um uh what we'll do is we'll do our best to answer all of those there were a few questions about gross margin and about um uh you know forward-looking statements and stuff like that and that's not really our job uh in this presentation what those kind of things will be covered by certain research notes so you know we can we can look forward to to getting some coverage there and that should answer some of those questions uh steve uh mike had a specific question about the south korean facility and whether you know that's currently set up uh to do samples or you know does it need to be scaled up you know my my kind of response would be we're always in the process of scaling up but there's always a need to get bigger to look at more available markets but what's your view steve yeah it's very application dependent so if if you are wanting to go into the display market you obviously need to make graphene as big as possible and as as uh high throughput as possible however there's there's tons of applications if you want to make a sensor uh you can make thousands of sensors with just like one centimeter square of material so um yeah it really depends on application but we we have everything in place to to be able to make uh graphene useful in a range of applications we will obviously need to work with other partners we need to find other because we will not be able to do everything uh we will not be able to make a final product uh and also for example working on things like bio sensing we need to work with some other partners that actually have some of that expertise that they can bring to us um and so yeah we've got we've got everything we need to uh to develop prototypes and other uh yeah for a number of different applications i don't know if you want anything else there neil no that's fine thanks steve um hopefully that's answered your question uh mike uh ken asked about initiatives in the field of batteries well obviously that's covered by our european subsidiary nanomat uh where we have a majority stake they're they're looking at uh using the graphene that we produce uh and that's how we came to know about the the spanish assets uh and then functionalizing those uh and and modifying those graphene materials suitable for super capacitors uh and and battery materials and they've been involved in quite a few projects now they're they're still as i said at the time of acquisition at a very early stage but uh obviously that's a big market to be involved in and one that um that we look forward to seeing you know quite a lot of progress in so yes we are involved in in the field of energy i would say and that's going to become more relevant as uh the environmental factors change um in terms of uh kind of uh specifics around you know where the cvd was sold well we're not going to tell you that unfortunately because that will let our competitors know exactly where to go hunting uh but jane asked you know was that supplied into south korea and i believe it was supplied into south korea you know what we see is that we're using the global footprint so that the materials that we're producing in the uk we can sell those in south korea and vice versa the materials that are produced in south korea we can then start to sell those in in the uk uh as steve said you know there's some constraints around that in terms of this isn't a a massive factory uh but it is uh enough to be able to satisfy our demands at the moment we're not looking at substantial amounts of capital equipment in the new year either you know i wouldn't discount uh the the need if it if it was driven by a commercial decision but um as it stands at the moment we've scaled up our main primary processes uh and now it's time to look for the commercial uh draw that's that's needed there so let's uh let's get that all that equipment commissioned and set up uh and uh and then produce the sales from from that equipment before we look too too far there was a question a pre-submitted question actually which is quite interesting which is you know do you see you know what's your business model around the production of graphene uh and and i kind of think that um at the moment we would uh look towards uh following both so we wouldn't discount centralized giga type factories but we will also wouldn't discount a distributed model where it makes sense so for instance uh if you've got a concrete manufacturer then it makes sense to have a graphene manufacturing plant uh very close to that to cut the logistics of the environmental impact of producing graphene to to you know to the very minimal it can be uh martine's just asked a question now about the green mark and i think uh yes we we have talked about that we've not wanted it yet but it would be uh would be part of our environmental push to look at uh the green mark and other environmental um changes and and uh accreditations um paul denny who uh is working on a lot of our g-scale projects uh is our head of sustainability and that's part of his um his role to look at our sustainability policies uh and to make sure that um that we're minimizing the impact not only of our factories but also working with our customers minimize the co2 impact of their processes as well uh there was a question about why samsung and hanwa relinquished the patents and equipment well you'll have seen that uh roughly 24 million pounds was or 24 million dollars i think it was steve was um was actually uh put into the business through uh national projects and uh in investment uh the the business of uh tequin was sold to hanwa and that included the the graphene assets as as part of a corporate deal in south korea and then subsequently uh uh hanwa are not in the business of uh developing graphene uh so you know we have the opportunity to to buy those assets and uh and to take on that development for them you know so uh that's uh that's kind of my understanding but um you're never quite sure in these corporate transactions you know what the main driver is uh there's lots of questions coming in now so uh there's some technical financial questions which we'll uh we'll refer to after the meeting and there's some questions about super dry i hope i answered some of those we're not going to get graphene into every product unfortunately because there are price points and uh and kind of benefit analysis that needs to be done but we are working with super dry on a large number of projects uh well i consider it to be a large number of projects it's definitely challenging for the team as it stands at the moment and they cover a wide variety of different products so um obviously we can't say too much because that's a commercial engagement and that's being key to our development in the textile industry the super dry are not the only people that we're working with we are working with a number of other people that we've talked about already we're not going to talk about uh our competitors what our competitors do is up to them uh we're focused on what for syrian's doing we have a very strong strategy uh really looking forward to diane joining us as the new chairperson in january uh she comes from a background of taking a business uh very similar to ours in terms of its size through to a main uh a main exchange listing and being involved in that whole scale up so i've worked with diane and known diane for a while i like the way that she works you know she's very challenging as a chairperson she's very good at corporate governance and for me it's about not only exploiting her relationships and her experience but um you know for the good of the company but um also you know learning from some of the mistakes and um and uh looking and reflecting on how we can do things within the company much better and diane is it's very good at that she comes from an operational background where the business has to scale very quickly and i think um that that experience it will be absolutely key to us uh there's lots of questions about um uh about you know forward-looking statements and things like that we can't answer those unfortunately um but we we will as i said before take those up with um with uh you know various bits of research uh that we're doing i'm trying to look at the questions as i'm talking as well um i think also worth pointing out that a lot of these technical questions maybe there's answers in our previous presentation uh given last month on the on this platform yeah exactly exactly steve and um uh and you know this is uh a quarterly update it's very close to the previous one because the previous one one was uh was reset scheduled and we hope to uh to have another one of these in uh in in the next kind of three months uh so that we can keep our shareholders up to date with what's happening and that's also an opportunity to for you to ask as many questions as you can um just looking through if there's anything here uh do we have any brian looks like he's been busy in the us which is true uh we've got a number of uh good opportunities in the us uh have you got plans for a manufacturing base uh well that will come on on the back of commercial success if it's relevant so that's one that we're keeping a watchful eye on at the moment we're quite able to supply that from the uh uh from the uk uh did for serious supply the graphene that went into uh there's actually seven kilometers of uh the a1m yes we did uh that was in the public domain any news on the university trials in terms of textiles yes um yourself uh and and bobby sat through a presentation a few weeks ago about the test results uh very very good news as far as i'm concerned that is forming the basis of not only the grapheneware website but also which bobby's working on at the moment but also a white paper which i'm hoping steve will be working on as well so uh how far are we away from making any decisions we're we're we're um at the moment demonstrating our technology to a range of customers so that's not a decision that we need to make in the immediate future uh god there's lots of questions here now we should ask them a little bit earlier um do we have uh sufficient production capacity i think i mentioned that earlier as it stands at the moment yes we've got plenty of capacity for what we have currently planned although we don't uh we're constantly monitoring that uh large companies they they take a long time unfortunately to uh to move and sometimes it's much better to look at uh smaller smaller ones we've got a question here uh this is one for you chris uh uh how much of the loan is due in 2024 i think um you know it's uh it's a scheduled payment uh that that goes on for it's a it's what we would classify as a relatively soft loan but yeah i think i think we said um back when we issued the rns we gave the details of that which was it's repayable quarterly over three years um so uh and that's you know that's the capital um we're already paying interest on this as well so yeah uh there's a question here from from andy uh did you enjoy puzzle x and the panel you were on yes i i did enjoy puzzle x it gave me a great opportunity to sit down with uh jose antonio who came as part of the spanish assets and uh and roberto uh to to talk about our plans for uh for syrian europe uh we we kind of hedging our bets over brexit when we set up the syrian europe but uh i'm pleased to say that jose antonio is now part of our team and i i wanted him when we were first talking to the guys in spain so that's that's a great result for the company he's also part of our business development team so someone asked you know do we have an international footprint well we have guys in south south korea we have people in europe and we have people in the uk obviously brian out in the us as well uh do we have any thoughts about future takeovers um well that's always an interesting thing we always keep a an eye out on what's happening we're monitoring the competitive environment in which we we work we've seen a lot of people fall by the wayside we've seen some new entrants and we keep our eye and we support as many people as possible the reason that we support them is that it's very important for the industry to have uh options you know uh if you have a monopoly it's very very difficult uh for large companies to actually um uh to actually you know build a competitive supply chain so you know i actually look forward to having uh good competitors in the market because it drives development and it uh it keeps everybody honest and uh and there we have um you know a situation where we're seeing consolidation in the market so yeah we do keep an eye out on all of our competitors and uh i'm sure that there'll be opportunities in the future uh we also look for acquisitions as we've always stated where they can advance the adoption of our technology so looking for people both behind us in terms of our supply chain but also in front of us so that's an active uh an activity that keeps both myself and chris uh busy uh unfortunately you have to kiss a there's an old adage that you have to kiss a lot of frogs until you find a prince well acquisitions there's no truer statement unfortunately i'm kind of running out of steam here uh there's a question mark about how advanced the commissioning of the new 100 tonne equipment is that's advancing well uh the mechanical side of the first machine is now complete and as i said earlier we're looking at the control systems because it came from europe we need to be compliant with the uk uh and um and we're in the process of uh making some minor changes to the control system there to accommodate that uh in terms of um uh in terms of communication we're trying to communicate as as much as we can unfortunately myself chris and steve are actively involved in the business as well so that limits the amount of uh communication sometimes we can do we work uh quite long hours uh but we try to keep the businesses uh or the shareholders as informed as possible through every channel we can so that includes podcasts that includes uh social media where we have a very tight policy and um and also uh events like this so we do we do like doing events with shareholders they can get to see the business and uh and hold the directors accountable so as far as i'm concerned that's a an important thing for us to do good i think that's just about us mark i'm looking at any of the questions that we that we may be able to answer some of these we may have to answer after the meeting unfortunately but we'll do us our best to answer every question we can that's absolutely no problem at all um nil and thank you very much indeed to all those investors that have taken the time to submit questions today um nil i'll shortly redirect investors to provide you with their thoughts and expectations and give you their feedback uh but i guess before doing so if you've

um you know i guess it uh it falls on the management team to wish you all uh the very best of uh season's greetings um it's uh it's been a very trying time for anybody that's been involved in business

employees uh who have gone the extra mile in some very very difficult uh conditions uh and i'd also like to thank uh the directors for all of their efforts as well uh and so um that's that's all for

 Our performance this quarter underscores the future earnings

 I'd like to touch on some highlights.

 By mid-September, several countries listed restrictions allowing fully vaccinated Brazilians

 Furthermore, as of November the 8th, fully vaccinated decisions are now allowed to travel

 dispositive trends across the region.
 just to summarize, our geographic diversification
 has been key in providing a more consistent overall performance
 for the company.
 Turning to slide 5, we have two really strong initiatives that we continue to deliver on
 and that I will discuss today.
 First, our loyalty program has been widely accepted,
 and we have reached the one million member milestone.

 In this regard, we recently signed an agreement

 Also, capitalizing on the increased travel demand,
 we launch our first offline marketing campaign since 2020.

 As the man has picked up, we also launched our first offline marketing campaign in second

 Finally, on the EEGF front, we launch our materiality survey last month and look forward
 to show the results in our next ESG report.
 Now, please turn to slide 10 for final remarks.
 Despite ongoing volatility and some macro merkeness, our long-term vision is, if anything,
 I wish you all the best.
 The initiatives required to realize it are pulled in the way, even as we work through
 new term market challenges and consumer behavior continues to adjust.
 Looking at the fourth quarter, the strong recovery observed in gross bookings in September continued
 into October, reaching 72% of 19 booking levels.
 In addition, we expect November and December to continue with these positive trends, benefiting
 from industry marketing events, such as the Buen FÃ­n campaign in Mexico and Black Friday
 in Brazil.
 December also marks the start of the summer season in LATAM, which would also contribute
 to higher demand in the region.
 In this context, we are stepping up our marketing efforts.
 while keeping a heightened focus on affordability.
 We illustrate the point.
 And on a weekly basis, we are launching a minimum of four
 unbeatable deals by country.
 while carefully balancing the price financing perception.
 With respect to the day, we are on track with integration of the in-destination activity
 segment and expect to fully finalize the integration of these acquisitions as planned by first

 We are also making steady headway in expanding coins acquisition operations.
 In addition to adding new logos in the B2B business segment in Brazil, we're taking the
 the first steps to launch coin in Mexico and in next year.
 Finally, we are in conversation with several suppliers across the region to expand our

 together with a positive progression in demand are quite encouraging.
 We believe that while podcasting is future performance,
 still present some challenges due to the ups and downs of the pandemic.
 We expect that the developments in the vaccination front will generate the confidence to go
 go back to normal travel patterns.
 The third quarter, and year-to-date results, reinforce our confidence in our strategy and
 and represent focus and discipline in executing our long-term strategic plan.
 This concludes our prepared remarks.
 We are ready to answer your questions.
 Operator, please open the line for questions.
 Thank you.
 We will now begin the question and answer session.
 To ask a question, you may press star then 1 on your touch-tone phone.
 If you are using a speaker phone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys.
 If your question has been addressed, do you
 like to remove yourself from Q, please press StarveN2.
 So, once again, ladies and gentlemen, that's farther than one if you have a question.
 And today's...
 First question comes from Ed Euroma with Key Bank.
 Please go ahead.
 Hey, good morning.
 Thanks for taking the question.
 And nice to see the sequential improvement.
 I guess a couple of things for me.
 First, I think you guys have done a really good job of,
 you know, rightsizing the business during the pandemic
 and making yourselves more efficient.
 Is there a way that we should think
 as bookings rebuild from an incremental margin perspective
 and how the shape made that for them
 what we've seen previously.
 And second, kind of as expected, you're
 going to draw down on the cash a bit, I guess, is people redeem vouchers.
 What should we think about the cash usage progression
 over the next couple quarters, and when will that trough?
 Thank you.
 Ed, Alberto, good morning.
 Thanks for your question.
 On cash I think we let me allow me to reiterate what we discussed in prior calls
 I actually recall your question, okay, we are looking at the similar levels to what we
 have discussed let's say like a minimum cash value for the year of around 250 okay in particular
 driven for the same reasons that you highlighted.
 would regard to
 In regards to margins, okay?
 Clearly, we are in the trajectory that we are actually
 reach and break even point, okay?
 We already, in the month of October,
 that we are closing those figures.
 Okay, we're seeing already blue lines
 when it comes to at an EBITDA level,
 that is particularly encouraging.
 and when you start looking at margins,
 Let's say top to bottom, okay.
 We are seeing a take rate at similar levels to the ones
 we have been discussing.
 Okay, let's recall what we have mentioned in prior calls
 about having a long-term trajectory on take-it at around 12 percent, okay, 12 percent plus
 that is higher in around 50 basis points,
 we will discuss a pre-pandemic.
 With regards to structural cost, what we have said is that the structural cost should actually
 benefit from, let's say, around 60% operating leverage, meaning that if orders were to grow
 around 100, okay, structural cost should be growing no more than 40%.
 And that, I would say, points to a picture on what could be the profitability of the
 company going forward that it should be in excess of what we were discussing
 pre-pandemic in the long run.
 Got it and maybe one other follow-up you indicated you're looking to kind of rebuild inventory for packages given some of the demand signals
 you're seeing. I guess how quickly can that happen and do you expect that you'll be able
 to have enough kind of capacity for the peak travel seasons.
 Thank you.
 We currently see, I think that answer has maybe two different ideas.
 The one is the company continues to be, let's say, on the sidelines when it comes to, let's
 say, the company is going to have to do something about it, and it's going to have to do something
 a secure inventory as we have done pre-pandemic, okay?
 I remember that we were actually at around, let's say, 5% or between 5% to 10% no more
 than that of all the gross bookings were selling were actually secured or paid in advance on
 capacity at hotels and or airlines. Okay. Since the pandemic struck, we were completely on
 the silence of that, and we are not thinking about starting to push into that arena as
 off, let's say, the next few quarters. And we do not see a reason to do it, given in
 Number one, the ups and downs of the business.
 And number two, we see capacity.
 So there's no need to do it.
 Okay, of course, we see that as a profitable business,
 And that will put our food on the gas pedal as we are fully
 recovered because we see there's opportunity to gain extra margin.
 But for the time being, we will not do it.
 In addition, and in general inventory, what we are seeing is that airlines are increasing
 their network significantly in Latin America
 for the upcoming two to three months.
 So everything that's available from the airlines
 and the hotel is going to be in the Stegard.
 and we are seeing increased levels of inventory on both areas.
 we are confident that the pace of the discovery will be sustained over the next few months.
 Very good. Thanks much.
 And ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder,
 If you'd like to ask a question, please press start on one.
 next question comes from Kevin Kuppelman with Collin and Company.
 Please go ahead.
 Good morning.
 This is Emily on for Kevin.
 And thanks for taking my question.
 You mentioned a new marketing campaign launching in Q4 focused on affordability, and I was
 I was just wondering if you could help us understand how that will affect revenue take
 great installments and sales and marketing expenses in the quarter.
 Thanks.
 Hi, Emily. Thanks for your question. This is Damian.
 The new campaign was extremely effective, it's been extremely effective, it's still
 running. And what we are pointing towards is getting back to travel and being able to afford
 to travel as we always have been positioned in the mice of consumers. We do not expect
 that this will represent or be reflected in any lower take rates.
 Remember that, as we mentioned during the very remarks, we have enhanced significantly
 There were many months in Capabini disease.
 So we are being much more effective in the past in increasing demand without having to
 to give up significantly on the tech break.
 So the numbers that Alberto referred
 in the previous question should be sustained over the next few months.
 Very clear. Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session.
 I'd like to turn the conference back over to the management team for the final remarks.
 Thank you very much.
 just wanted to thank all of you for your participation
 an interest in despegar.

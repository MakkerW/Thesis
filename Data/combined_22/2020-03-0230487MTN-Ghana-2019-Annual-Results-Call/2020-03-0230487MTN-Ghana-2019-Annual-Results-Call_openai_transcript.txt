Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the MTN Ghana 2019 annual results call. All participants will be in listen only mode. There will be an opportunity to ask questions later during the conference. If you should need assistance during the call please signal an operator by pressing star then zero. Please note that this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremiah Opoku. Please go ahead sir. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss MTN Ghana's annual results for the year ended 31st December 2019. I am Jeremiah Opoku, the Investor Relations Manager for MTN Ghana. With me on the call today are Salam Adadibo, CEO of MTN Ghana, Modupe Kadri, former CFO of MTN Ghana and Kobna Bentiencho, Acting CFO for MTN Ghana and Group Investor Relations. Salam will provide you with an overview of the company's performance for 2019 and outlook for this year before we move on to the Q&A session which will be facilitated by the conference call operator. With that, over to you Salam. Thank you Jeremiah. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for making time to join us on this call today. I will provide a brief overview of our performance for the year ending December 2019 and speak a little bit about the outlook for this year 2020 before handing over to the operator for questions and answers. We're excited by the strong performance delivered by MTN Ghana, the team here for the year 2019 and in a competitive industry while maintaining market leadership with 55% market share. We grew service revenue 3% year on year driven by strong growth in voice, data and mobile money. Voice revenue was up in double digits and increased by 19% year on year supported by growth in our active subscriber base, continued improvements to our network and the impact of various customer value management initiatives and pro-customer activity which encouraged increased usage of our services by our customers. The contribution of voice revenue to overall revenue edged down from 45% to 45% from 46% as expected as new lines of revenue continued to grow faster than the traditional voice business. Data revenue growth was strong at 33% year on year and was attributable to the higher number of active data subscribers and smartphone users on the network as well as an increase in data usage across our customer base. Data contributed 28% to total service revenue up from 26% in 2018. Mobile money revenue also contributed on a strong trajectory increasing by 28% in a year in which we marked 8th anniversary in Ghana. Growth in mobile money was driven by the ongoing expansion in the number of active subscribers and increased transactional activity as well as good growth in advanced services such as retail merchant payments, pensions, remittances as examples. Mobile money made up 19% of overall service revenue compared to 18% in the prior year. Turning to EBITDA earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, this grew by 6% with a year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion of 13 percentage points to 51% on a reported IFRS view. When comparing on a like-for-like IAS 17 basis, our EBITDA margin increased by 4.8 percentage points to 42.5%. If we further normalize for management fee, then like-for-like EBITDA margin expanded by 5.9 percentage points to 43.5%. The margin improvement was supported by tight control on operating expenses as well as distribution efficiencies. In terms of CAPEX, we invested 1.1 billion Ghana cities in support of the growth in the core business and improving the participation and quality of service to our customers. MTN Ghana acknowledges the outbreak of coronavirus worldwide and its potential impacts on our supply chain. While we monitor unfolding developments, we're exploring multiple scenarios in a bid to mitigate the impact on our business. On the regulatory front, the Payment Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed in May last year into law. This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required of existing players such as us, we have duly applied for the new license. MTN Ghana maintains ongoing engagements with regulatory stakeholders with a firm focus on sustaining cordial relationships and achieving continued improvements in customer experience. Following the expiry of certain technology licenses in 2019, the NCA regulator has renewed our 2G license for 15 years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our international gateway and fixed access licenses, which are pending NCA approval. We continue to invest in our communities with the MTN Ghana Foundation and support reaching a total of 149 projects since inception in 2007. In 2019, the Foundation initiated 8 new projects in education, 3 in health, and 1 in economic empowerment. The Board declared an interim dividend of 2 pesewas per share after reviewing the media performance of the company. After reviewing the full year performance of the company, the Board shall be recommending a final dividend of 4 pesewas per share, bringing the total dividend for 2019 to 6 pesewas per share. This represents 73% of profit after tax and a 20% increase in dividend per share. Before I comment briefly on prospects forward and the outlook, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some changes in our management, which Jeremy touched on a little earlier. As you may be aware from our release to the market last week, our CFO, Modupe Kadri, and an Executive Director of MTN Ghana has been appointed to the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director role of MTN Nigeria effective 1st March 2020. As a result, Kobna Bentiencho has been appointed to act as Chief Financial Officer until the replacement process is completed. This process is underway and we will update the market once finalized. On this note, I would like to wish both gentlemen the very best in their new roles. In terms of the outlook for 2020, 2019 marked the year of the customer for MTN Ghana and in 2020, we're building on that foundation as we transition from a traditional mobile telecoms operator to an emerging digital operator. As a business, we're well positioned for continued growth as we invest in ongoing improvements in quality of service and a drive to increase participation of Ghanaians in all our service offerings. In line with our transition journey, MTN Ghana has declared 2020 as the year of the customer, the digital experience with a firm focus on digital. The focus on digital is a tool to enhance customer experience as well as create value for our shareholders. At this point, I'd like to hand over the conference call to the operator for questions and answers. Thank you very much once again. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your touch tone phone or on the keypad on your screen. If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star then two to remove yourself from the list. Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one. We will pause to see if there are any questions. We have a question from Mangalis Otlamini from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. This is Mangalis Otlamini from JP Morgan. Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Two questions from my side. One relates to the 2G license renewal. Could you provide some color as to how much the renewal costs, please? And secondly, on the mobile money services, with the change in legislation and application for the new license, is this a simple administrative tick in the box or is there more to the process? Could you maybe just talk us through the process there, please? Thank you. Well, thank you very much for the question. Let me start with the 2G license. And the 2G license was renewed at $25 million. This was an industry renewal, and both ourselves and Vodafone had this renewal. And the validity or the tenure of the license was 15 years. In terms of the mobile process, the new act, the PSSA, Payment Systems and Services Act, I believe the question was whether this was an administrative tick in the box for the regulator or whether there was something else behind it. I think the spirit behind the PSSA, two or three things here. The first one is in 2014, there was the EMI, which was the Electronic Money Issuer regulation that was passed, which allowed telcos to take more responsibility in managing agents and accounting for customers as a customer of the mobile money operator. Before that, it was actually bank-led fully, and therefore those assets were essentially owned by the banks. The PSSA is intended to expand on this by allowing fintech, the broader fintech community beyond the mobile money operators, to also have a framework under which they operate. That being said, that allows some sort of regulation and oversight for the fintech community that has an impact on the mobile money industry overall. But the second thing was also after the banking sector cleanup was also

also to institute certain mechanisms that allow risk to be managed in a structured format so that we can prevent a similar situation from happening within the mobile money or the fintech space. And then the third thing is really to strengthen the governance processes with the central bank themselves with the growth in mobile money over the last three to five years and have had to update their internal processes for better governance and understanding of this space. So this will be the three main drivers and certainly a positive framework from our perspective in terms of enabling the environment and looking out for a future that is going to continue to be dominated essentially by the mobile financial services and the fintech companies in terms of how we manage financial services overall. Thank you. Our next question is from Prashendran Udayar from Nedbank. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. It's Prashendran here. Just following up on Magdalisa's question, so it sounds like yes, that this new act is more encompassing, but do you as management see any roadblocks in terms of actually getting this license or is it something that you're kind of like pricing? And the second question on the regulatory front was I read somewhere that in December you did get fined by the regulator for service disruptions. Can you give us an update on that? Has that all been resolved or is it a once-off thing or something that we can expect more of? Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first question which was on the risk. So any potential risks of getting the license? We don't actually foresee that to be a major constraint. Obviously, we have to also be diligent in our submission, which we have done, but we don't see any major roadblocks from where we sit at this stage. The process will end in June, and if there are any changes, we'll update you through that. But we certainly don't see any risks from our position currently. In terms of your second question, which was about the fine and whether that's all been resolved, yes, we received the fine for $100,000 in December following the implementation of new services. That situation was resolved within 48 hours of us receiving the fine. I don't believe that we can expect any other fines in terms of the business. The fine was $100,000 in total. It wasn't per subscriber or anything like that. No, it's $100,000 in total. That's correct, yes. Okay, no, thank you very much. The next question is from Moses Zawu from Bloomberg. Please go ahead. All right, thank you very much. My question is now telecoms are moving closer to higher, you know, AGs. Why would you still want to renew your 2G license? That's my first question. My second question, are you indicating that there is potential for the coronavirus to impact your supply chain? Please give us some more details. Have you started getting any sort of impact? And if you talk about potential, in what form could it become serious? Thank you. Thanks for the question. In terms of the 2G license and why we thought it was important to renew it, and just to give you some context, today we have approximately 40% smartphones on our network, which means we have 60% of our users today that do not have a smartphone and rely on 2G services. Now, in as much as, you know, smartphone users have a higher ARPU, you know, the 60% given on a lower ARPU is a very significant component of the business. So, you know, we really have no option if we have to continue to grow the business forward to renew the 2G license. However, we're also expecting that in the next couple of years we should see universal access license implemented by the regulator, which would mean that we can reappropriate the 900 and 1800 spectrum under the 2G for higher generations of technology. So we had that in mind when we're looking at the renewal. But we definitely didn't have much of a choice for the renewal since we have a huge dependency on 2G currently in terms of our base and the mix of smartphones. In terms of the coronavirus, you know, our measures today are proactive, and we're basically preempting a potential situation down the line. So we haven't had any impact on the business currently. But in anticipation of what may happen, we're making sure we put in place the right processes to prevent any impact on the business going forward. The next question is from Jake Ward from Ashmore Group. Please go ahead. Hi, thanks for the call, guys. A couple of questions, if I may. Firstly, given the strong growth in the voice ARPU, I wondered if you could just expand a bit more on some of the initiatives that have driven this and your expectations for the business in 2020. And secondly, despite the strong year-on-year growth, it looks like the mobile money revenue came in just a little bit softer in Q4 based on our numbers. Can you just give some color on what drove that? Thanks. All right, thanks for the question. I'll take the first one, which is around the voice ARPU, what the expectations are for 2020 and some of the initiatives that support the voice business. So we see the voice business as a business that's gone from being the most significant business to now a business that we're managing forward. And so by that, we're minimizing our above-the-line campaigns in terms of voice and doing a lot of below-the-line campaigns, which takes us into an area called customer value management, CVM. And so what we're basically doing in terms of voice is to look at profiles of customers and try to define specific products and services that suit the specific behavior based on the characteristics and the attributes of that particular segment or that particular user. So this has been, I would say, the primary mechanism to manage voice in order not to impact the growth in some of the newer areas, which would be mixes between voice and data users. In terms of the expectations for 2020, we have a very strong desire to continue to drive smartphone growth. So we would expect to see the mix of smartphone and non-smartphone changing in favor of smartphones. However, with the rate we've seen historically, we won't certainly change the baseline for the non-smartphone users, and we'll expect to see a reduction in that base, but continue to still be significant and strong. As such, the activities on CVM will continue, but the focus to drive growth and secure the future of the business will be largely driven by the smartphone base, what we do in terms of apps, my NTN app, music apps, gaming, things like that, as well as the enhancements in customer experience to ensure that we can drive more transactional activities. So that will really be the focus for 2020. In terms of the mobile performance, there were some changes in Q4 which impacted the year-on-year revenue growth. And the most significant of which is part of the PSSA meant that there was a change in how the interest revenue on Momo floats was distributed. And that change would have given us an additional, so without that change, we would have seen an additional 10 percentage point growth in Momo. So that's the primary driver of the drop. And the organic business continues to be very strong. Expect to continue to see that growth in 2020. That's great. Thank you very much. The next question is from Joyce Agbozo from Databank Brokerage Limited. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you very much for this call. My question relates to the cost efficiencies that I see in the business. So looking at the current figures that were posted, it is that the cost declined or reduced significantly for some of the major cost items. I want to know what drove that. Thanks for the question. I'll just, Muzipe is on the line and he would respond to that and the cost. Hello, thanks for the question. The cost efficiencies mainly on both fronts, on the cost of sales. So we were able to optimize our relationship with the international carriers. So we had a lot of savings on incoming international calls. And then on the OPEX side, we also had some optimizations reviewed various contracts that we had with service providers and the leverage on our site. So basically what we've done is to optimally, to continue to try to optimize our operations such that we'll see much of this going forward. And you're going to see much of that in the coming period too, to continue that. All right. Thank you very much. The next question is from Floris Sienkamp from Coronation. Please go ahead. Hi there. I also have a question on the payments license. I mean, you briefly mentioned the changes in Q4, but I was just wondering what are the main changes for your business under the new license? I mean, any services now that you can offer or can't offer, you know, or fees that you can charge or not charge? So just the main changes for the business. And then secondly, also on this, what are the costs involved? Is there one sort of license fee or an annual cost related to this? And then lastly, there were talks in the past of a 30% local ownership requirement for mobile money businesses. And I'd just like to hear your thoughts on what's the latest on this? And does this new license address that at all or is there still something that's a bit of an issue? Thanks. Okay. Thanks for the question. So just very quickly on the first part, which is what were the main changes

So the two significant changes in terms of the business. Mind you, the core business continues to run. There are no significant changes or no changes at all on the core business. However, in terms of the interest on float, that's where the changes happen. So before the changes in Q4, the float interest was split 80-20, where 20 goes to the operator like us and 80 goes to the customer. The changes there have been a reduction to the operator. So it's no longer 20% to the operator. It's now 10% to the operator and 90% to the customer. But also what has changed here is the interest on float, which is regulated by the central bank. And that number was 7% prior to Q4 and has been reduced to 4%. So the entire interest scheme has changed for the float earnings. So these are the two main changes. However, on the operational side, in terms of the products we offer that we've built internally, there's no impact on that portfolio at all. In terms of the 30% local ownership, the PSOC has clarified the 30% ownership now, which is in terms of 30%, it's measured on the capital required to get the license. So for us to be a dedicated EMI, which is called a DEMI, and we need a minimum capital requirement of 20 million Ghana CDs. The local ownership is 30% of that 20 million capital required, which is 6 million Ghana CDs for us. So we're in the process now to finalize that. But it's a pretty straightforward activity now than what has been suggested in the past. Our next question is from Douglas Holm from Deccan. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for the call. I was wondering if you could just give us what the voice, data, Momo, and digital revenues were for 2018 and 2019. Okay. Just bear with me one second. So total voice revenue, I don't know if I got the last part, but total voice revenue was 2.318 billion Ghana CDs. Data revenue is 1.461 and mobile money revenue is 959 million. And what about the other digital revenue? Digital revenue, just bear with us one second if that's not in there. 199 million in terms of digital revenue. Okay. And then it looks like Momo is down about 23% in the fourth quarter. Is that what you guys have as well? Because we're trying to back into a fourth quarter number here. Sure. There was a question earlier on, you know, what drove the change in the Momo trend from Q3 to Q4. And it's largely the change in the interest scheme, both on the float interest and the split between customers and operators. Right. So I guess the business, the peer-to-peer payments, the transactional payments, can you give us an idea of how much that grew year on year? So most of the key lines, I mean, the mobile money drivers would be cash out revenue as well as peer-to-peer revenue. Cash out is about 60% and peer-to-peer is about 30%. And both of those are trained about the same rate as the total business of about 28% year on year growth. That's right. And then in terms of the 30% local ownership requirement, you know, 6 million Ghana CDs of ownership, I would assume that the IPO already satisfies that requirement. So that determination has not been made yet. We've submitted the application and the central bank is currently reviewing that. So we'll get the response to that in due course. But yes, the 6 million in terms of the value of the business is quite a small amount. So we don't expect this to be a hurdle to actually even localization from the perspective of mobile money. And then what was the management fee amount in 2019? Okay, so I'll just pass that to Madupa Tuhando. All right. Excuse me. The management fee amount was 192 million. Okay, and then in the direct network costs, you know, they appear to have fallen year on year, but I believe part of that is just simply moving lease costs, operating lease costs out of the direct network operating costs. So, you know, I guess the 624 million, if you wanted to look on it apples to apples, do you add 430 million for lease costs? You add 430 million, that's correct. Just one last question on kind of the outlook for 2020. I mean, can you guys give us some high-level thoughts on, you know, revenue growth by the major buckets, voice, data, and Momo? Okay, we don't have that split, but our overall guidance is, you know, we'll maintain our overall guidance in the perspectives for year three. Okay, and what about margins? Well, with our guidance, we should be tracking our guidance for margins as well. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. The next question is from Timothy Roshuk from Ventura Capital. Please go ahead. Hey, guys, this is Ray from Kent. I have quite a few questions. Just starting out with mobile money KPIs, a couple that you've mentioned in the past. The first one, I was just wondering what transactions per user per month looked like for 2019. And then I guess total amount of remittances as a portion of mobile money revenue or mobile money transaction volume, what the yearly transaction value was for the mobile money product, and then any updates on your subscriber market share. All right, so I don't know if I can answer all of them immediately, but we'll certainly get back to you on the ones that I missed. But let me start with the transactions per user per month. So the two most popular transactions, which will be in line with the revenue split as well, will be P2P and cash out. And it's typically five transactions on P2P and five transactions on cash out per user per month. In terms of cash in, it's very similar to P2P at 4.5 transactions per month. And these would be the three main transactions. The rest are really small transactions that are continuing to grow. We're seeing good growth in merchant payments and bill payments, but the transaction frequencies are quite small. In terms of the update on the subscriber share, just to clarify, is that subscriber share in mobile money or is that subscriber share on the core business? Yep, I would take both subscriber market share numbers, both Momo and then the core business. Momo and the core business. Okay. Correct. Thank you. So in terms of our core business market share, we're at 55.2% in terms of the core business at the end of 2019. In terms of the remittance percent of total revenue, remittance is about 1.6% of total revenue. And in terms of our mobile money subscriber share, we're at about 74%. And I believe those would be the questions that you asked. Yeah, and then I just had a couple of follow-ups. So one, that 74 is last year you were at 94, right? So that's a significant drop. I guess what has led to that 20 percentage point change in market share? Okay, so just to clarify, the value, the 94% you refer to is actually the share of the total transacted value. And on that basis, we're still above 90%. And the subscriber share has remained about the same in the marketplace as well. So these are two fairly stable numbers despite the 28% growth in the business. I hope that clarifies. Got it. And then did you give a number for yearly transaction value? I think last year your transaction value was 151, or maybe 2017 was 151 billion CDs. I don't think I have a 2018 number, but I was wondering what the 2019 transaction value was. Sure, we'll come back to you on that. And we just have to rely on the disclosures by the central bank, so it's consistent. So we'll come back to you on that. Okay, sounds good. And then last question. So just seeing the obvious operator split of the interest off the float come down and then the interest rate that's being charged or accrued in that float, is this something we're going to see another part of the cycle in four or five years, another updated act where that gets stripped down to the operators taking no share of interest income off the float? Is that where we're headed? No, I don't believe we will get to the point where there's no interest for operators. And I think this trend was really facilitated by trying to promote, one, more interest back to the consumer, which is where the 90% came in. In terms of the reduction in the interest rate itself, this is something that the central bank is managing. And we've had quite a tough financial industry. There was a restructuring last year. So that's all driven by – sorry, that's the result of some of these activities. So I don't expect to see major changes to these numbers going forward, but certainly not getting to zero interest. Got it.

And then just final question on subscriber growth for mobile money. It looked so active data subs were I think 9.5% for the year and then active mobile money subs were up 4.6% for the year and then overall mobile money subs were up 1%. Do you have any view on an acceleration or deceleration in subscriber numbers? I mean what is the lever you're looking to pull here? Sort of converting the inactive subscriber to an active subscriber or are you further focused on monetizing? I mean is the actual subscriber growth kind of on the back burner now and you're more focused on the monetization of what you have? Or how do you think about that strategically? You know you're absolutely spot on. I mean last year there was a bit of a focus on monetization and launching more advanced services. But certainly we've started this year on an acquisition drive. So we should see growth. We should see continued growth this year as well. Got it. Awesome. Thanks. The next question is from Omar Ismaili from EFG Hermes. Please go ahead. Yes, thank you. Thank you for taking the call. So please could you name some of the existing partner banks that you're working with on the Momo wallet? That's my first question. Second question is does the Payment Systems and Services Act change the nature of these relationships? And if so, in what way? And my last question is on the reduction in the interest for float. That's come down from 7% to 4%. Is there a provision in the existing acts that allows for a revision upwards should rates in the market change? Thank you. All right. Thanks. I'll have Mudit answer the first two questions which are around the banking relationships. And then I will take the question on whether we expect on the provision in the act that can affect the interest rates. So I'll start with the provision and I'll hand over to Mudit after that. In terms of the provision, there is no provision in the act itself. And the 4% and the 7% are not governed by the act. These are more operational tactics by the central bank. So there isn't a provision per se. However, these are discussions we'll continue to have with the central bank on trying to maximize the opportunity with interest going forward. I'll hand over to Mudit to handle the question on bank partnerships and the implications. Well, in terms of bank partnerships, nothing has changed. The guidelines doesn't stipulate any changes. So we still maintain the relationships we have with the partner banks and also trying to increase that ecosystem as it were. I'm not sure I got your second question. I mean, there was a second question, but I thought if there was, please kindly repeat it. Yes, I was just asking, I don't know if it's a long list, but if it's a short one, I was just asking for you to name the partner banks that you work with on the Momo wallet. Oh, we work pretty much with most of the key banks, especially the EcoBanks, the GT, StanChart, pretty much 22% banks. Okay, thank you for that. The next question is from Nitinand Bhatt from the CanValley Investors. Please go ahead. Hi, guys. Thanks for the call. Good question to continue this discussion on this float, on the float part of the business. Can you give us a sense of the total value of float generated by Momo during the year 2019 and how did it grow versus 2018? Right. So the float size for MTN was in excess of 3 billion CDs. And the growth, just trying to get my numbers. Yeah, so the float grew to over 3 billion CDs as of the end of December. And pretty much that floats it on MTN mobile money platform. And it will be like 7.3, we're waiting for the official figures to be published by the central bank. But it will pretty much be in that line, in line with what I've just said. And okay, and just a second, just trying to get the exact numbers for you. So the 3.4 billion as of December 2019 compared to 2.43 billion as of December 2018. Got it, got it. And typically, what is the duration of the float? How long does this float stay in, you know, if you put 100 Ghana CD on day one, how long before it goes into the system again? What? Okay, so the first way I can answer the question as long as the subscriber has an electronic wallet, it must be backed by cash within the float. So as long as those wallets exist, then the floats must be represented by the cash. So the numbers we talked about, the 3.4 billion CDs are the cash value of the electronic wallets. So how long it stays in that ecosystem depends on what some of the things I talked about, the transactions, how much you're able to keep within the ecosystem and how much is actually cashed out of the ecosystem. But given the numbers we gave that I just quoted, 2.43 billion as of the end of December 2018 compared to 3.4 billion as of 2019, that shows that the product is increasing because we've also created different uses in terms of what people could use on the ecosystem. So you have increasing merchants, merchant payments, the agent footprint and things like that, that's actually boosting the whole mobile money ecosystem. Understood, understood. And the partnership with the banks, right? So the interest that you get on the float, you said it's going to be split 90-10 now, 90 with the customer and 10 with you, with Momo. How does the interest rate compare to the deposit rate that the customer would get if they just put the money in the bank? Okay, so two things. Finally, for most people, if you think, if you look at the mobile money wallet as a typical current account where you currently earn zero, no interest on your balances or your current account, then you will look at the mobile money product as the next best thing because you could earn up to 4% or thereabouts on your mobile money floats. So if you look at those two, which is the proxy for each other, basically, it's either you have your money in your current accounts or your mobile money wallet. So you have the ability to earn interest on one, whereas you have no ability to earn interest on the other. So that's how it compares. As far as the interest rates, the interest rates are regulated by the central bank, so they are kept low. There will be increased dialogue on that within the industry so that we can get more value for the subscribers. But at the moment, that's what it is. It's been regulated by the central bank. And like you rightly said, the whole objective is that those floats or those monies belongs to the subscribers and as such, they should be remunerated accordingly. So what the new Payment Services Act has tried to do is to codify that in black and white, that 90% of the money generated on the floats should be sent to the subscribers. And that's what we're doing. Next question is from Alina Thir from Virgin Asset Management. Please go ahead. Hi, thank you for the opportunity to ask questions. Just to follow on the interest rate structure scheme, just curious whether you've seen any change in behavior, perhaps, you know, the incentives to maybe contribute to the wallet today. I hear you talk about the difference between the current accounts and the wallets, but generally speaking, have you seen any change in behavior towards people contributing to the floats via the wallet as a result of the change in the interest rate scheme? So that's the first question. Right. Okay, if I could take that. I think there are two ways to look at that. One, we have found that your float balances are growing from 2.43 to over a billion, more or less, in a year. That's more than about 50%. It shows that it's attractive to some. That's one. Two, most of the people in the mobile money ecosystem are those who are actually on the banks who probably could not have access to a banking account. So having been brought into the, under the auspices of financial inclusion, obviously, they would continue to invest in that activity or continue to partake in that activity. So I'm not sure it would be right for us to compare like for like because the bulk of this, the majority of these people were outside of the financial inclusion, financial system. So I think in as much as the floats are growing due to the activities that people can now do on their mobile money wallets, I think you're going to see that number potentially increasing. At what rates, I can't say.

But I could definitely say that the interest may not be the major driver of why people are coming to the ecosystem. It's more of the convenience and what they're able to achieve with having a mobile money wallet. That's clear. The second question, I think you alluded earlier on in the call to value-added services such as pensions and things that are outside of the P2P transaction type. Can you talk about the percentage of value and percentage of transactions that's coming from value-added type services in the mobile ecosystem? The question was on what was the contribution of the advanced services in mobile money. Is that correct? That's correct, yeah. It's about 11%. In terms of the contribution. And it's safe to say that 11% carries a higher margin compared to the traditional P2P business? That's correct, yes. Because the traditional business has a commission deduction which doesn't apply to this. That makes sense. The last question is just on management fees. This reminds us that the MTN group charged any management fees on Momo revenues or EBITDA. Just wanted to get a sense of that. Well, at the time we submitted our application to the GIPC, all total company revenues was the intent. And that's what's in the guidance given. So the management fees are actually for all services. Bear in mind that even the mobile money platform is supported by group technical and stuff like that. So that's the concept. When we actually applied for the management fees approval, total revenues which included the revenues from what is now mobile money limits. Okay. So just to confirm, it does include mobile money. So was that a question? I just wanted to confirm. You're saying that the management fee would include revenue from mobile money, from Momo? Yes. At the time when we submitted the application, that's what was approved for. Okay. And those management fees have been charged and have been remitted up to the group? Yes, they have been charged and those are the early figures we quoted. And they've been charged into the financials. Understood. Great. Thank you, guys. The next question is from Penta Drave from Blakeney. Please go ahead. Thank you, guys, for the presentation and the time for the call. I just wanted to quickly ask you, in terms of the merchant payment and merchant agent, agency network, what's the evolution year on year? And the second question is regarding the impact of the changes in regulation, the new PSA Act, the impacts of this on the Q4 mobile revenue. What should we expect for the full year 2020? Do you think some of those changes will be offset by increased usage or do you see an impact coming through in 2020? Okay. So let me answer the second question first and then we'll come back to the first question. So in terms of the changes for 2020, we'll expect to continue to see strong growth in mobile money on the revenue line. And the focus really on mobile money is to continue to drive merchant payments, and we should be at about 2% of the total revenue, but we should see that continue to grow as we gain more merchants. In terms of the year on year, we ended last year with about 80,000 merchants and we finished, sorry, we ended 2018 with about 80,000 merchants and we finished 2019 at about 100, over 100,000 merchants. So we should see good growth this year as well in terms of merchant services. But more importantly, we should see an increase in the transaction per merchants with the merchants that were newly onboarded last year. So we would expect some good growth from that. Thanks. The final question is from Ken Allo from SSNIT. Please go ahead. Hello. Thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on your performance. I see a lot of the banks now coming up with their Momo business, and I want to find out if from your projections, how far would these banks' businesses affect your Momo business? Thank you. So thanks for the question. And I think it's too early to tell, but if I just sort of take an industry perspective where the mobile money industry is still very, very young, the opportunities for transactional activity is massive. If you look at the stats that I gave to an earlier question, I mean, customers are doing five P2Ps per user per month currently and about five cash outs per month per user. I mean, that's a very low number. We should expect that, you know, in its mature state, you should expect 20 to 30 transactions per user per month. On the basis of that, I think, you know, having new entrants in the marketplace, that can allow customers to get more used and comfortable to digital currency will continue to help the industry and the ecosystem continue to expand. So at this stage, it's very difficult to tell the direct impact on us as a business. But I do think that as an industry, we should expect the industry to continue to expand quite rapidly the more the players come in and help us develop the ecosystem. Jeremiah, we have no further questions. Okay. Thank you once again for making time for today's call.

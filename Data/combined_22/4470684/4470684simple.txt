 is mic on yeah our mic is on initially we go to that yeah thank you ladies and gentlemen let's take our seats let's take our seats please hello ruby i like your new suit i can't see you're gonna have to wait for a few minutes all right um at 11 o'clock we will go on to the webcast so we are not going to start yet so so so so ladies and gentlemen good morning and uh welcome to uh 100 grayston here in senton and welcome to uh 100 grayston here in senton and welcome to any of our shareholders analysts and colleagues who are joining via the webcast how wonderful it is that after 18 months of significant struggle with covet we can once again get back together in one room obviously we are socially distanced but it is fantastic to welcome you to 100 grayston um before i start let me just say that uh we are going to talk about numbers today which which are obviously quite important um but this business is not only about numbers our business is fundamentally about our our clients and about how our people serve our clients so i would like to acknowledge both for our clients and for our people that covet 19 has been devastating a great challenge but i'm glad that we have survived covet 19 and that we are now somewhat at the back end of it so thank you to our clients for your support and thank you to all our 8 200 colleagues for delivering out of the ordinary uh to our clients our business is obviously about profit but we are also about impact and at the end of the day hopefully you will see both profit and impact coming through so at the end of today i hope that you will appreciate that uh our business is fundamentally strong after a period where we went through a strategic simplification and refocus of the business and also that you will agree that we have a set of client franchises that are high quality and very resilient and that resilience will come through in the performance that we will be reporting today i'm very very proud to stand here on behalf of my colleagues and present these fantastic results that we're going to be talking about today we've made significant progress over the last two years or so and at the end of the presentation i hope you will agree with me that we are well poised to capture the opportunity for growth that we think lies ahead for our business today if we start by focusing for the next few minutes on the journey that we have traveled over the last two years the journey to simplify and to focus the business this journey started with the due measure of asset management in march 2020 the idea was to give each of investic in 91 the freedom to pursue their strategies and growth prospects and what a fantastic story it has been since march 2020 91 continues to fly and investic has flown even higher so we are particularly pleased about the decision to demerge uh 91 and of course hendrick and the team had a fantastic set of results on tuesday and we are very happy as a 25 shareholder at those results we exited as part of this journey to simplify our business a number of subscale businesses we we exited territories also where we thought we couldn't compete we also exited businesses where we thought the risk profile is no longer appropriate for us as we go forward so today i'm particularly pleased that in our journey to simplify the business the board has now taken a decision to distribute a 15 percent holding in 91 we can do so because our business continues to generate strong capital our business has the power through its franchises to continue to do well and we also did commit to you that we will continue to optimize our capital stack this is an important step there will be other steps that will come in future just to put this in context we've now distributed 70 percent of 91 at current market values that represents a return to our shareholders of 1.7 billion pounds or approximately 34 billion rand very proud that we can bring this to the conclusion that we have brought it today in addition to simplification we said to you that we will give the business greater focus we will be focused largely on two geographies on bank and wealth and we will compete only in those niches where we can excel because we did not intend to be a bulge bracket bank as it were in our international markets so we have to be excellent where we choose to perform that focus will be evidenced today by a growth and revenue of 30.5 percent which we believe is quite fantastic we also will be able to demonstrate through the results that we continue to exercise significant cost discipline our fixed cost grew by 3.3 percent and the rest of the increase of 11.7 percent obviously reflects variable uh expenses in particular variable remuneration in line with the growth of 30.5 in in revenues lastly we are now at a point where we have a platform that is neat and tidy a people that is motivated and we look to capture the opportunity that lies ahead of us so going now to the results firstly it is quite clear that there has been a significant rebound uh in the economies in which we operate and this has been uh quite helpful although we do have some uncertainty as we look forward looking at financial markets again we we have had supportive financial markets so this will reflect in some of the growth that you will see uh in uh our funds under management and that also will be helpful in certain valuations but if we look forward global interest rates have been at record lows but we now are beginning to see the specter of inflation on the horizon so going forward inflation is going to be quite a big item on the agenda with uh central banks having hoped that uh the signs of inflation that we saw were transitory i think there is now a real sense that this inflation may be anchored as we go forward therefore we expect rates to go up as we go looking at the results we are at a point where our operating profit at an adjusted level adjusted operating profit is now at pre-pandemic levels so the recovery has been swift showing the resilience of our client franchises so we've seen good growth in the loan books we've seen significant growth in funds under management driven both by markets uh net inflows and good investment performance at an adjusted earnings per share level we've seen growth growth of 135 percent to 26.3 p very pleasing performance indeed our net asset value has grown at an annualized 9.3 percent to 479.2 pence relative to a a share price of around 360p there is still a gap that you uh we we still need to uh to eliminate over the next little while as we execute on our current strategy our return on equity uh has been printed at 11.2 percent we are now coming very close to our medium term range of 12 percent to 16 percent remember we've had an interruption uh that has been caused by the pandemic pleasingly our cost to income ratio came in at 64 percent relative to the prior period of 72 percent driven by obviously a significant increase in revenue but also characterized by the fact that our cost control has been excellent as we go forward cost discipline remains an important factor in the work that we do if you look at the credit loss ratio at seven basis points obviously a historic low driven by low specific impairments the experience on the ground uh is is that we are not seeing uh much uh come through albeit that we still see that the environment remains uh particularly uncertain we also saw significant recoveries in this period on a net basis while there was some release in provisions given uh the the improvement in the economic scenario we did have a net increase in covert 19 overlays given as we can see some of the uncertainty in the markets the interim dividend doubled from 5.5 p to 11 p to reflect the confidence that we have in the performance that we have seen i've spoken about the distribution of 15 percent of our holding in 91 on a per share basis that adds 35 p to the 5.5 sorry to the 11 p uh dividend that has been declared obviously there are a number of uh uh regulatory and other approvals that we still need to procure and we do expect that within this financial year we will be able to execute on uh this distribution very pleased with as i said the return of capital to our shareholders if we move to the next slide this is a depiction of the recovery in performance and given the news on 91 we've also separated the contribution of 91 to our earnings as you can see the blue that is investec has performed particularly well in terms of recovery so our confidence in our business and in our people is at an all-time high the momentum in the business continues so we look forward with a lot of confidence looking at uh how this performance has been achieved it is pleasing that we are firing on all cylinders starting off with the specialist banking business in south africa adjusted operating profit increased by 69 percent in rents well done richard and if you look at the the wealth business in sa 18 percent up uh in rents henry is uh on his way flying from uh oh i think he's in switzerland actually he comes in uh back tomorrow well done henry and team uh group investments up significantly and if you look at south africa as the geography uh we saw adjusted operating profit up 94 percent in pounds and 76 percent in rents that is a fantastic achievement in an economy that has been struggling because we haven't seen economic reforms that we require to unlock the potential of the economy so we are outdoing the macro so i'm really proud of our team uh in sa the roe in pounds for our south african business is now at 12 percent versus september 20 roe of 8.1 significant improvement overall if you look at our uk business um we saw the specialist bank increase its profit massively but in truth this is just a continuation of the growth momentum that was in the business and this momentum as you know in the prior period was interrupted by the losses that we experienced in our finprod business as we said in this results uh the costs associated with both management of that risk and reduction of that risk were immaterial so we can see a resumption of growth uh in in that business our wealth business grew adjusted uh um earnings uh operating profit rather by 46 percent again a fantastic achievement uh by kieran and the team i forgot to acknowledge ruth and her team for this stellar performance in the bank in the uk in this area of our business we are still very small within the uk context so the road forward is really rich uh with opportunity in south africa we are a big player we have a strong brand and a strong presence so we can fight our way even in an environment where the economy is not growing as we would like it to grow so a pleasing performance by all our businesses at the same time i'm not going to cover the next slide that goes into the exact details of the performance of the performance of each of the businesses i will leave that to our group finance director nicholin to take us through that as i prepared to hand the mic to nicholin to take us through the results i want to stress again that we manage for profitability but we also manage for impact we've just had cop 26 over the last two weeks and i'm pleased to see that the path to net zero has become a lot more accepted around the world even though the transition from a climate perspective will probably be a bit slower and a bit more costly than uh we we may have uh desired as that transition occurs we also have to make sure that that transition is just and the social impacts of the transition on poorer communities is well understood investec we continue to embed the thinking around climate uh change around sustainability goals that are fundamentally into our business we have we have a policy on coal we have disclosed both uh exposures on coal which as you can see is quite minimal at 0.11 of uh of our loan book we also have disclosed fossil fuel we are very proud of what we have achieved we've also committed that going into the next agm we will give a scope three targets around uh the issues relating to climate change so sustainability is core to us as you know at invest that we've always said we are committed to creating enduring worth living in society and not of it nishlin do you want to come up to just unpack the results in more detail thanks nish well it's actually amazing just to be up here hey and to see so many familiar faces across uh let's hope it uh long may it last and let's head in the right direction so if we get into some of the detail i think just a reflection um you know again as fanny had highlighted we did have some interruptions uh over the last financial year we're not totally through all of those interruptions and we've got to recognize uh that the journey ahead is still a journey that one has to navigate through but we're quite proud of the fact that both our geographies have contributed strongly in terms of these results with south africa um contributing 59 percent of the operating profit and the uk contributing 55 percent of overall revenue i think when we talk about the distribution of 15 percent of 91 when we look at the divisional contribution the overall contribution from our group investment portfolio is about five percent of revenue the actual portion of 91 that we will be distributing accounts for about two and a half percent of that revenue and we you know we strongly of the view that we will grow into that as we move through time i think through this period both our wealth businesses and our specialist banking business which i know we set we we represent as a single bond which has multiple diversified business streams and and and revenue streams within it uh you know with that business contributing 72 percent of revenue and 75 percent of operating profit and our wealth business 23 percent of revenue and 17 percent of operating profit that we dig a little deeper let's start off with our wealth and investment business in south africa i think the first point to note is a net 10.1 billion rand of discretionary funds under management inflow in the period which was really underpinned uh the growth in operating income of 22.6 percent in the period representing higher average annuity income and discretionary funds under management and the contribution from that particular base in the period we did experience increased brokerage as trading activity on the markets picked up over the period and overall adjusted operating profit increased by 17.8 percent to 311 million rand with the operating margin being achieved at 31.5 percent which yes it did come in a little and that's really driven by investments uh investment in terms of the the platform and people uh but still a relatively strong and and respectable uh operating margin across the industry um i think it's also worthwhile noting that we've got continue to have sustained inflows into our offshore offerings from the wealth and investments uk perspective funds under management grew to 44.7 billion pounds over the period with net inflows of 627 million pounds we saw the operating margin improve for our uk domestic business from 20.6 percent 20.5 percent to 26 percent um over this period and that's not would stand in increased uh discretionary spend as well as uh continued investment in terms of the platforms and uh variable costs obviously uh following the improvement in profitability i think again net organic uh growth in funds under management of three percent really supported by higher market levels over the period organic growth in funds under management and favorable investment investment performance across the portfolio moving on to the bank in south africa um core loans and advances grew by 3.4 percent or close to 7 percent on an annualized basis and and that experience is across our private banking business as well as our corporate business over this period um the private banking business obviously uh benefiting from the lower interest rate environment and the opportunistic nature of the client base but again continued good growth in terms of client acquisition uh which bodes well for the future in terms of our corporate and lending book which grew by close to a 7 percent annualized rate uh over this period that is within an environment in which we continue to see higher repayments as corporates continue to manage their excess liquidity on the balance sheet deposits growing by 6.6 in the period and i think you know some of the defensiveness that has uh that has been on the balance sheet through the covert period we will continue to grow into uh some of that uh defensiveness it's very pleasing to report at 22 percent growth in overall revenue from 5.8 billion to 7.1 billion over the period and i think if we look at where that growth has come from net interest income is a key driver in terms of the growth with net interest margin really uh improving and and us getting through the sharp decreases in interest rates that we saw impact the first three months of the prior year that coupled with book growth and continued efforts in terms of managing the cost of funds and obviously a favorable environment uh that is that that continue to assist around that fees and fees and commissions as well and that's a split between annuity and deal fees and commissions saw healthy growth and that's really a return of activity and and and and a drive-through in terms particularly around our private client businesses investment income in this period actually had a slightly negative return um and that's really on the fact that we did not have any significant realizations uh in this particular period the cost to income ratios improved from 55.4 percent to 49.7 percent and that's off the back of continued management of fixed costs which increased by 3.7 percent um and operating costs overall increasing by 9.1 percent well offset by a 21.6 percent growth in revenue when we look at our uk bank we are particularly plow proud of the growth in in core loans that we've experienced over the period and yes there have been some tailwinds that have assisted that but the client acquisition remains constant and contributing to the underlying platform with core loans and advances increasing to 13.7 billion pounds or around about a 12.4 percent growth if you adjust for the fact that we had disposed of our australian book back in march um 20 uh march 21 actually our private client lending uh activity and book is actually up 19.6 percent and that's largely driven by client acquisitions demand for corporate credit was strong over the period and that's really tantamount to the economic recovery that we have seen in the market and in particular in the client spaces that we operate in and around about 9.5 percent again adjusting for australia from a customer deposits perspective you've seen that customer deposits haven't necessarily kept up with the growth in loans and advances and that's really intentional uh dealing with some of the conservatism that we built into the liquidity base to navigate the choppy markets that we've obviously operated through again looking at revenue overall revenue increasing by 20 percent from 273 million pounds to 328 million pounds as funny had alluded to you know if we factor in that our structure uh structured products costs of last year in terms of hedging and managing that particular portfolio was 53 million pounds it was relatively immaterial at just over a million pounds in this period and looking forward you know we we continue to expect that that portfolio now which has had which has significantly reduced because of positive markets and active management will continue to be immaterial as we look through the full year the cost income ratio has improved from 80.7 percent to 72.8 percent with overall operating costs increasing by 8.1 percent now if you unpack the operating cost increases and i will do so a little later you will see that fixed personnel cost has actually reduced as we have gone through quite a significant restructuring the business and we continue to see the benefits of the steps taken earlier operating um the cost income ratio i've i've spoken through and i think if we just unpack a bit of the the revenue aspect net interest income increasing by 24.6 percent over the period is fundamentally driven by growth in the book as well as net reduction in the cost of funds uh in that business as well i think again one has to adjust uh for the fact that we have exited our australian business so there will be an impact on revenue and costs and really adjusting for that you see a stellar performance in terms of the underlying business our group investments portfolio in terms of an overall carrying value of 834 million uh pounds generated um income yield in the period of about 8 percent 91 which represents about 25 is in our books at around about one pound 60 which represents the equity accounted uh value of that investment relative to market value and therefore you do see um that the current market value of our overall investment portfolio sits well above uh the book carrying value um from a distribution perspective if we use the relative value that is on here from an accounting perspective that's 240 million pounds much more significantly when you're factoring the fact that it has a market value of just over two pound 60 per share so again a pleasing um recovery in terms of the return uh with return on equity for the overall investment portfolio at 10.1 percent with us seeing an improvement in profitability in the underlying portfolio as anticipated in ipf as well as investec property fund also generating reasonable returns in this period would reduce momentum in terms of property write downs that we had experienced before so coming back to the overall picture if we look at revenue growing from 729 million pounds to 951 million pounds over the period you can see the drivers coming from three key areas and that is our net interest income growing by 30 percent really underpinned by the performance in our specialist banking businesses net fees and commissions improving by 19 there are elements of moving parts in it but the underlying momentum coming back into the business investment and associate income growing by 36 percent um and that's really the contributions coming from our investments in our associates um and trading income really represents the recovery of a non-repeat of the structured product costs that we carried uh in the prior period our overall annuity income uh closing at about 78.1 percent so if i go back to the you know the graph obviously we we have to emerge our asset management business which brings in capital light businesses uh capital light revenue but within the specialist banking business as well as uh with you know the the world business there is still a healthy element of capital light revenue in in in in the platform but to the extent that we we seek to utilize our excess capital i think the focus will continue to be on capital light overall cost to income ratio for the group really driven by two factors improving to 64 percent and that's an improvement in revenue fixed costs increasing by 3.3 percent and an element of variable cost picking up which has driven operating costs increasing by 11.7 percent a breakdown of our costs premises has cost a bit more in the period with some of our restructures we have about three million pounds of excess costs that will uh not repeat as we move forward personnel cost is really driven by variable remuneration if we had to split that between fixed and and variable the fixed personnel cost is has reduced uh over the period and variable following the revenue improvement business and marketing costs obviously following the path that we are following poster post-covid environment from an earnings drivers perspective i think we are very encouraged in both funds under management growth as as well as our core loans and advances with funds under management growing by 8.5 percent to 63.4 billion pounds over the period with net inflows of 1.5 billion pounds and that again driven by favorable markets investment performances in both our geographies core loans and advances has increased by 7.2 percent to 28.3 billion with customer accounts following closely breaking down our loan book in south africa our core loans and advances has seen growth of 3.4 percent or 6.8 percent on an annualized basis one will have to unpack the detail between these various components but the corporate book really experiencing growth of around about seven percent in this particular period and our high net worth book that's on an annualized basis our high net worth and private client book continuing with elements of growth as we had seen in the second half of the financial year from a uk perspective again the growth in terms of core loans and advance has been experienced across the portfolio strongly supported by 17 percent growth in in the mortgage book six percent growth in our high net and specialized lending book and again good experience of our corporate lending portfolios across the portfolios including our asset finance and corporate and acquisition finance as well as power and infrastructure finance books coming to expected credit loss ratios yes we do have quite a a low credit loss ratio in this period of seven basis points that hasn't been primarily driven by releases of impairments it's really driven by the fact that we don't have momentum in the current period on new impairments being raised and that's two factors number one is the the the level of specific impairments remained low and that's reflective of the performance of our underlying client portfolios uh client portfolios uh and the strength of uh of uh you know the uh the underlying portfolios themselves the second is we did have some heightened recoveries over the period and that that recoveries is really driven post uh write-offs over the last couple of years and continued effort in terms of uh recovery of uh recovery of assets has paid off during the this current current period and again with some clients recovering uh as markets opened up we also have uh you know from a macroeconomic perspective the pressure of raising impairments as we saw in the second half of 2020 has completely disappeared and that's as the forward look in terms of the macroeconomic economic environment has turned from negative significantly negative to positive now like anything in life i think we're still in a period in which trying to measure what the outcome is and to try to get to specifics on different portfolios is it's it's it's not a simple task of simply modeling so we've continued to maintain post-model adjustment overlays and in certain instances we've increased some of our post-model adjustment overlays to take account of risks risks that are still prevalent uh you know if one has to you know understand that there has been interventions in markets and as those interventions work out the system there may be elements of risk the pleasing aspect to report on is we don't see any evidence of that yet uh and you know we continue uh to experience a good overall outcome in terms of asset quality from a south african perspective our our credit loss ratio was four basis points with 108 million rand worth of charge uh impairment charges relatively low over the period um i think if we go back to a pre um covert environment our credit loss ratio was about 18 basis points and that again was significantly driven up as we provided for risk on the balance sheet on a fold looking basis in south africa again we have to some degree retained protection on the balance sheet and we will continue to do that as long as there are levels of uncertainty which are not necessarily easily modeled from a uk perspective our overall credit loss ratio at nine basis points in this book we did raise some of our post-model overlays to account for economic uncertainty there have been model releases over the period and i think that's a consistent experience across the book and when we get to asset quality you will see a continued strong momentum in terms of overall quality the annualized credit loss ratio you know coming down from 60 basis points in the prior period so both in south africa and the uk material impact on the uh positive impact on the income statement over this period from a balance sheet perspective it's never easy to give you a simple analysis of the balance sheet because of the moving parts particularly around uh certain write-offs that we pass so for example um in the plc balance sheet the decrease of 101 million to 73 million of uh stage three provisions is really driven by write-offs over the period of about 40 million pounds overall um the level of impairments uh raised on balance sheet really staying relatively intact and from a south african perspective again some migration between stage two and stage three influences the analysis but you can see from our overall coverage ratios um you know they are there are movements in terms of coverage ratios particularly for stage three and that's really driven by specific assets and the relationship with collateral uh from an roe perspective um we report an overall roe of 11.2 percent with south africa producing a 12 percent roe and plc 10.5 percent with both balance sheets utilizing around about 2.1 uh to 2.2 billion pounds of capital the return on uh tangible equity at 12.1 percent representing really the return uh from our wealth businesses that provide quite a kicker uh into the rot analysis coming to the balance sheet and to our capital positions um i think both investic plc and investic limited reporting robust capital positions i think let's just take a note that uh investic plc reports under standardized basis and the 11.1 percent uh ct1 ratio is is measured on a relatively conservative basis if one has to look at the density of risk weights um to overall asset positions and total capital ratio for plc at 14.8 percent with a leverage ratio of 7.8 percent from a south african perspective we did see the ct1 ratio improve from 12.8 percent to 13.9 percent part of that is a continued completion of our journey to arb we still have one material element which we refer to as our capital required on our income producing real estate which is not in this measure yet um so south africa continues to operate a quite a significantly heightened ct1 ratio and that to some degree does have a challenge on roe but from a overall position perspective uh strong capital ratios and strong position uh you know looking forward in terms of both supporting growth and potential acquisitions um and at the end of the day the distribution of 91 in our in our view will have an immaterial impact on the overall capital position of the group this slide just effectively takes stock of where we are against our medium-term targets and i think i'm not going to repeat through all of it just to note that our distribution uh or the 11 11p dividend amounts to about a 41.8 percent payout ratio now if we look forward and again i think you know one's got to recognize that we're looking forward in november to a march year end the macroeconomic environment is improving and and we've seen that on all fronts whether it's in the geographies that we operate in or the businesses that we operate in however that that recovery remains uneven will be continued to be tested and i think in south africa the risk of a fourth wave uh related to covert 19 the level of vaccine rollout and the the the the general socioeconomic challenges uh remain concerns and in the uk as we see the effects of brexit and the continued play out in terms of uh the repositioning of the united kingdom relative to europe we may see some impact across some of our portfolios from an earnings perspective i think we are we are very pleased to report that we have increased our expected reported eps targets or um projections from from 41p at the upper end uh that we had delivered uh you know as some guidance into the market um to 48 to 53p for the full year and that guidance has taken into consideration the lower impairments that you've seen in this particular first first half but generally a continuation of the momentum of the business as we have seen in the first half and the group remains um committed to the targets that we have raised so that's the finance section and funny back to you to wrap it up for us thank you nishlin i'm sure as a finance director this must have been the easiest set of results to present the results are fantastic uh representing an incredible business um that's why initially can today revise upwards the guidance for the year in terms of uh adjusted eps to um 48 p to 53 p well done nish just in closing um um it is important to note that we have strategic clarity about the business we are an international banking and wealth management group with two home geographies of the uk and south africa we are fundamentally committed to supporting our clients in their journey of growth and that growth over time is transformational we have a rich history and heritage in private banking in wealth management in corporate banking in investment banking we are a niche player we excel in what we do uh and we continue in our two geographies to see significant opportunity in south africa we operate at a large scale in all the businesses that we operate and we are a standard setter in terms of the businesses that we operate in the uk we have refined our business and the niches we operate in and we continue to see significant scale build up as i said earlier during the day we have significant opportunity for growth three years ago we committed to investing in the private banking offering in the uk you have now seen the level of growth that we have achieved in that business when ruth presented in in in may she went through those areas of that market where we have chosen to compete and the path to growth is particularly significant on the wealth side in the uk as i said both bolts on at the lower end and uh um consolidation um type opportunities um type opportunities remain and we have a people that is empowered by a culture that gives them a freedom to operate high levels of trust for our people and our people have a spirit of enterprise they act like owners of the business and deliver innovative nimble solutions to our client and as i say we offer out of the ordinary both in terms of service in terms of product uh and uh and innovation so as we move forward we have strategic clarity we have a focused business resulting out of that we are confident as a people and we have a level of ambition uh that drives our outlook the next slide i'm not going to cover it goes over the same uh factors over the last two years we have looked at a framework to drive improved business performance despite the fact that we were interrupted by covet we have been able to show significant traction in our identified growth in growth in growth initiatives we have made significant progress with respect to a cost discipline initially spoke about what we have done there in terms of these results and that journey continues we've also have been significantly making progress around capital discipline the distribution initially of 55 of 91 now today um 15 as announced um and uh the the the the the path towards arb which will uh see us have even higher levels of capital in south africa the reduction in the uh investment portfolio in essay so we're excited about our ability to grow and as i said earlier on we can distribute the 15 percent because we have an engine that generates strongly capital and we are allocating that capital in the best way we know how as we go forward we have to continue to invest in our operating platform so the idea of investing more in both our technology and digitalization to make sure that we can provide continued high-tech backed and supported at the same time by high touch that investing is known for is really important so we're going to be investing in the business and we will deliver as we do so a connected ecosystem from a client perspective but also a leveraged operating platform as we move forward so we're excited about the work we have done and you can begin to see the results just taking stock of what we have been doing when we started uh in fy 2019 in march we recorded 48.7 p of adjusted earnings per share of course we had for 11 months i am now 91 we are now guiding uh to 48 to 53 p in terms of adjusted eps significant progress as we go forward obviously in the 48 to 53 p we've made some assumptions about when we will distribute the 15 percent uh the 15 of 91 our total operating income is now at 952 and again you can see that progression total costs at just under 600 now you can see that if you double that you will actually be better than you were in fy 2019 if you look at our weighted average number of shares we committed in 2019 uh at our market day that we will rein in any issues of shares that overall the direction of travel will be to maintain if not reduce the number of shares out in the market we've grown our ordinary shareholders equity as you can see and uh we continue to make uh we haven't made as much progress in terms of uh um uh reducing the investment portfolio given the environment but initially indicated to you what distributing 91 means to that our capital levels are strong in south africa once we get the remaining uh portfolio on to advance richard will not cease to complain about the drag of excess capital uh on returns in the business but that's a good problem to have rich i will say um in the uk we are on standardized we are now setting our sights as we go forward on looking to go on advanced as nicholin says if you look at our risk density you will see that we have a capital base that is particularly conservative um and and and both liquidity and capital are very strong to support our growth going forward so in conclusion we see the business being positioned to capture opportunity as we go forward there are identified organic growth opportunities that we have talked about before and richard can talk about those uh next time we have the opportunity to showcase uh our brilliant south african business bank and wealth i made an example of uh investment in the uk banking business we can talk about uh the investing life opportunity that we have here in south africa that we have invested and so we've got executable and scalable uh growth opportunities within our current business we obviously are leveraging our client ecosystem as i indicated and we also are looking at strategic partnerships where we could work with partners to provide our services and products to the relevant part of of their client basis there will always be some opportunities for bold on acquisitions and in particular in the uk on the wealth side that particular space will continue to to develop and provide opportunity with the advent of the d measure of asset management uh in from 2020 march we did say that the composition of our revenues shifted significantly more into capital intensive banking revenues so strategically we would like to rebalance that so both on the banking side and uh the wealth side we would look for uh the opportunities that are capital light and there are lots of those uh on banking for instance transactional banking services in south africa that we are uh ramping up on the on the business side would be one such example so the rebalance of the revenue mix is an important strategic driver of the work we do as we go forward also because uh 91 was larger larger uh in the uk than it was in in sa our geographic mix has also changed somewhat so as we go forward we will look to drive a better geographic mix as i said as we go forward we've got to invest for growth and our investment in technology will reflect not only business as usual but more how we support growth growth so we feel uh confident given the results given the momentum in the business and given uh what our people are feeling and the level of engagement with our existing clients and our ability to attract new clients uh to my colleagues proud of what you have achieved happy to take questions michelin do you want to come up take a seat and then we can bet on questions uh where's uh where's um um tesh where do we start tesh we start in in this building right ruby you are back so i'm gonna uh give you the opportunity to go first as i said earlier today i really like your new suit you shoot yeah thanks for me thanks mr tti i have one question please regarding the page operating cost analysis it states that costs increased by 11.7 percent and one of the reasons refers to increased discretionary spend there is a component there called business which went up 11 million exactly what is business nish you try to explain but you want to unpack a little yeah i was looking at malay in the crowd at the end of the day business is a combination of course a cost so it will include travel um it will include some of the the spend in in in managing the buildings and managing the infrastructure that we have across the geography so marketing and marketing is a little separate from it but overall business expenses really represents the supportive uh expenses you know and it includes to some extent audit fees and other aspects of running the business thank you yeah good morning hi morning i'll take this off i can't hear myself um my name is barry i'd just like to know on a question of management you are distributing the 91 shares would you not use those funds to reduce the shares in plc because the business in in uk is much reduced and there's a fortune of shares outstanding that has basically be fed from south africa in the old days it was meant to be even that was one the second question investec wealth and management is run as a separate company as i understand it's not wholly owned by investec and then i'd like to know what the net asset value of the last staff trade was of each share thank you okay um i'm not sure why you say that investing wealth and investment is run as a separate business in south africa starting off there we have an integrated platform uh richard is the country head henry obviously runs the wealth business we have the same operating uh platform as it were the client uh facing part of it obviously will will always be uh be separate uh in the uk which is probably where you may be referring to uh the wealth business we own 100 of it uh there's also it used to operate completely independently in terms of uh infrastructure marketing hr and the like so the client facing part of it still operates separately it's an investment business not a banking business what we have done is uh the the infrastructure side uh hr um the buildings um marketing we've centralized those because those you can you can actually centralize uh set in uh spending on technology around uh uh telephone systems and the like you used to for instance have different ones you used to have uh essentially if you uh phoned in from the bank in the uk to the wealth business you would be uh regarded as as an external one so the operational side of it we have rationalized without uh closing off the strategic possibility that we could merge that business at another stage with uh with another business so um very very uh happy with the quality of that business as we go forward uh again on both sides of the scale we we own a hundred percent of it if we were to consolidate obviously we could either buy uh completely um on a bolt-on basis or we could merge with another party in which case we could uh uh be below a hundred as we did with rensberg shepherds but we are an owner of the wealth business it's integral to our strategy so we wouldn't be selling and we would over time hope to go back to a hundred percent control with respect to the dlc structure next you want to take that yeah so a couple of quick points is number one is we've remained active in terms of acquiring shares so our for example our treasury stock has increased from just over 80 odd million to about 90 odd million um i think if we look at the distribution of 91 we've been quite clear that the level of surplus capital in south africa uh is much higher so that distribution will have a skewed impact on south africa which will be well supported by the underlying capital base um and to an extent we we will retain uh the majority of the remaining stake from a uk balance sheet that gives us optionality so as we look forward i think there are certain restrictions in terms of the dlc structure that would restrict our ability to use capital generated in sa in the uk as you say two-thirds of the shares are plc being a third if you think of our total share register a third limited two-thirds plc but in the plc you've got um imps and you have those plc shares owned by south africans a third a third a third but there are certain restrictions as you can imagine as a management team we continue to apply our minds as to how we could address the fundamental logic behind your question so generally agree with the fundamental logic behind your question there are structural and legal impediments to that um thank you any further question okay nothing in the building steven i'm not giving you a chance to ask a question um i can see you getting excited a bit um we're going to go to the chorus call i think right so we have a question from no questions from vds no questions okay shall we go to the webcast there's one question oh sorry clearly my hearing is not as good as as i would like it to be yeah let's hear it you can hear me um thanks very much for the presentation and uh congratulations on the strong results i've got a couple of questions firstly just what what was the reason for upgrading your earnings guidance quite recently after you've had your pre-close brief and is it mainly due to low cost of risk credit losses or were there other drivers of that so that's the first question and then secondly in terms of your roe target of 12 to 16 percent you're currently sitting at 11.2 percent but that's on particularly low credit losses or cost of risk uh what would be the levers to increase the roe to within the 12 to 12 to 16 percent range you want to give it a try and then yeah sure um i think our order committee drilled us on why we were so off our forecast because we delivered that forecast to you on the 18th i think of september um and it was really a factor of all the businesses so you had certain transactions that closed out ahead of expectation um credit losses you know to the extent that we had factored in certain thought processes the economics actually continued to improve and head in a direction that we had to factor in in terms of finalization and the reality was you know if this happens now and again but every single business had contributed to the the the push above um our our particular guidance so there's nothing specific to pull out as a as an absolute um uh driver and then if you're looking forward in terms of uh in terms of ro you know roe uh yes i agree with you in terms of the credit loss ratio um but i do think one's got a factor in the nature of investix business um and um at the end of the day uh the expectation that will continue to operate at you know whether that's 30 to 40 basis points or 25 to 35 basis points will finalize that calibration as we look forward because our asset quality is talking to a lower impairment expectation as we look forward but what's fundamentally going to drive us moving forward is number one is the slide that uh farney had highlighted at the very end which is the organic growth in the business where and that's really the funds under management as well as client acquisitions and there are particular drivers within both our banking businesses and our wealth businesses that are targeting particular growth areas that are spread across the client pools that we operate in and we'll continue to engineer and work in terms of driving those number two is you know we we we we've we we're starting to move out of the pandemic environment and the world is obviously with challenges but we we anticipate seeing the momentum of the business to continue to to tick in number three is probably an element of capital efficiency that we are going to have to bring in uh and whether that is a deployment in terms of acquisitions or whether that is um as you've alluded to in terms of managing the total number of shares in issue that's an exercise that we continue to apply ourselves across i think what we had said was uh with the advent of covid we had said our medium term i think that was in may would have been two to four years given the recovery in the economic landscape despite the uncertainty i think you would be looking at these um medium term targets more to closer to the lower end of the two to four range given the interruption of covert i think our businesses have proven to be very resilient a high quality and as i said in each of the markets we have executable opportunities uh for growth um and as i said watch uh that uk bank uh as as it uh continues to build scale and relevance uh with with clients and watch uh also the improvements that we have seen um in in the uk wealth business and as i said in south africa you have uh standard setting businesses across across the piece and yeah we we are confident about where we are and thank you for your congratulations on this set of results as i said our people bust their guts uh to serve to serve clients and these results are a consequence of what we do for clients any further question from uh the webcast yes quite a few questions from the webcast so there's um three questions on 91 i'm going to combine them the first one is from chris stewart 91 please can you give please can you give some insight as to the impact on the capital adequacy ratio of the proposed distribution of the 15 of 91. the next one is from mark detoy um will there be any tax payable by investing on the distribution of the 15 percent in 91 and the last one is from jonathan berry he's a private investor concerning the distribution of 15 of 91 quoted as being worth around 35p per share will this distribution be made in the form of shares or cash funny you happy for me to get through it i think the first point i would make is that we will issue a circular which will detail uh all of the steps that are to be followed and whether that's tax consequences or the actual structure from an overall perspective given the regulatory treatment of 91 in a banking balance sheet uh we carry significant deductions against the underlying investment so particularly in the uk we will see virtually no impact in terms of the underlying cat1 ratio and in south africa you know that will be a number that is well managed within our overall capital base itself um in terms of the question around the nature of the distribution well the way i think of it is we demerge 55 percent we're now adding 15 on top of it and when we finalize it it will follow through the similar process um that we had gone through um at that point in time but it's it's going to be in shares and the consequences of how you deal with that as a shareholders in your hands uh there is a part to follow uh there are certain things that we have to get right in terms of how it is structured so as i've highlighted in due course um there will be a circular and a process that will be followed in terms of the distribution we did consider whether we should uh um sell the stake uh to distribute cash but that was not uh the most uh beneficial uh to our shareholders so we did consider that as a as an option uh the option that we know that we're looking at uh in our view having done the work will be the most beneficial but there's a lot of detail still to be uh processed um for us to get to a point where we can give you a chapter and verse in terms of the mechanics of the impacts around tax etc etc but we're doing a lot of work with it i mean obviously with a distribution uh shares going back into the market we will work with our colleagues um at 91 to make sure that uh if any shareholders have as much as they want of 91 we can help uh in in uh working with them to absorb any overhang that may develop so and by the way we will remain a shareholder 91 at 10 percent so it is in all our our interest in the shareholders of 91 to make sure that we can manage the distribution as effectively as possible nish capital impact from chris stewart um i thought i dealt with it earlier so did you virtually no impact from a plc perspective and well you know i can mention it i think we expect around about a one percent impact on the south african uh capital ratio okay thank you there are a few more questions canal kalyan from risk insights investing has taken a number of initiatives towards improving on esg however from a competitive advantage perspective how do you see yourself using esg to differentiate from the market how long will it take for the market to see this differentiation and where would it be reflected yeah i think we we generally in in the south african environment seen as a leader in the space obviously there are risks associated with uh in particular climate which every uh financial services group in fact every uh business has to understand um and uh economies and industries have to understand the risks and opportunities that are attended uh to climate change and uh uh esg specifically uh so uh in a in a banking business uh there are specific opportunities in terms of uh either raising um certain funds or investing in certain renewable um assets and we do have exposure already um and over time uh reducing um fossil fuels the way we see it is obviously coal is the highest carbon content at the moment uh our policy would be to support coal only to the extent in south africa that we are dealing with uh uh eskim because without eskim and electricity the social side of esg would be a problem for the country in fact the economy would collapse anyway so we're looking there for transition and we would look at uh at guess as a transition fuel better than coal but in the long term uh steel high carbon and obviously renewables uh will be uh the the final solution on the uh so so that there's a lot we can do uh on the bank side in terms of opportunity with respect to um our investment business even there we have a number of opportunities in terms of uh in terms of related uh products by the way um on on the funding side of the business there are certain advantages that are beginning to arise depending on your level of esg progress we have raised a number of sustainability linked loans as an example so this is a this is a big issue for the world in terms of risk but from a business opportunity those businesses that do not take this stuff seriously are likely to suffer some disadvantage as we go forward excited about the opportunities i said in the presentation we are looking to embed even further sustainability thinking um inside of our business mark detroit from oyster catcher what are the growth opportunities in wealth uk business do you expect the contribution to profit from banking versus wealth to be closer to 50 50 in in time from the current 70 to 28 look it would be a foolhardy of me to try to predict uh composition of profits uh in the long term the strategic intent is to increase capitalized revenues as we go and we really focused uh on that we had a board meeting yesterday and some of our directors were saying let's see how we can measure that progress as we go forward so it's something that the board has a significant interest in but it's it's progress that we will report uh as we go with respect to specific opportunities i'm sure mark uh will know that uh we couldn't uh uh comment on that i said specifically there are two types of opportunities in wealth one being uh bolt on one to five billion pounds of assets under management and the other being at the largest scale um where obviously uh consolidation has to happen that's driven by uh uh opportunities of the benefits of scale driven by certain cost drivers like technology regulatory etc etc driven by business model changes for instance that need to go more into into financial planning as opposed to just investment management so there are industry trends that work in favor of consolidation uh so we will stay close to those developments uh we will always make sure that if we do participate we will do so on a basis that is strategically and commercially sensible to our business okay so there's two final questions um chris again from 91 any guidance on progress as to the disposal of the iap equity investment portfolios we continue to work on the overall uh reduction of the investment portfolio we are not we are not going to dump any assets these assets are valuable and as the environment improves i think the opportunity for us to realize a specific asset for good value uh so patient uh with our high quality assets uh but also understanding the need from where we sit to allocate capital much more uh effectively so i won't talk about a specific asset i'm sure chris will appreciate that last question from matrix fund managers well done on the great set of results given these low credit loss ratios are you not worried at all about the consumer environment which sectors are still much more in your watch list how soon do you wish to get to your roe target what would what would what would it take you to get these sooner and how do you plan to keep these roes within your targets maybe he wants to come to the board meeting next time because these are just too uh detailed we said to get to our targets we uh said medium term two to four years while we were still looking at a different scenario around covet i said earlier probably more to the lower end of that range in terms of timing there are many initiatives that both myself initially talked about around where we think we can improve uh performance as such i mean the questions are a bit too detailed uh for to address uh in uh in a an announcement of this nature one more one more my goodness we are firing on also in this from the question perspective my story is an investor congratulations on your very good performance why aren't you fully disposing of your interest in 91 what is the merit of having a minority holding of 10 percent okay if i could just remind miles about uh the strategic logic behind this we said that we wanted to sell 10 percent of 91 to bolster our capital stake in the uk that is what we said very clearly um at the time um when we de-merged uh markets were very volatile 91 is at about uh i think traded at around 140 we took the view that it was too cheap we wouldn't as i said about uh assets in the investment portfolio we are not into dumping assets or selling us as cheap so we took the view that we will not sell so the strategic intent around the 10 percent remains that it is part of the capital stack of of of of the uk business in saying that i've almost given you too much information around the structure of how we intend to distribute the the 15 percent i mean you can do uh some arithmetics not even maths so um our intent hasn't changed um we are not looking to be uh to do anything that we haven't said we had clearly signaled that 15 percent is access to uh to our requirements and now that we are emerging uh significantly from covert we think the time is right to return um that 15 percent to our shareholders i hope that makes sense okay i think that's uh that's uh the end of uh of the presentation again just to repeat we are excited about where we are i'm very proud of my colleagues uh for producing this level of results and as i said our business is about clients uh fundamentally and while we manage for profit we also manage for impact and we look forward to the next six months and the next six years the next 15 years although richard and myself may not be there in that time steven you had 40 years to run i don't think we have that much ahead of us so we're looking for a fundamentally strong business that has high levels of profitability and returns but lives in society not of it and makes good impacts thank you so much for your interest and attendance see you in another six months is that a nation yep in mark thank you so much

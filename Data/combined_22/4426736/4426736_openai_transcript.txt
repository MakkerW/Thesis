I now hand over the call to our CEO, Mr. Ririk Adrian Shah. Thank you, Ririk. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call for the full year of 2020 results. We really appreciate your participation in this call. Amidst challenging time for business environment due to prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, Telkom has successfully managed business and financial performance. We recorded Rp136.5 trillion in consolidated revenue, increased 0.7% from previous year. Our EBITDA grew by 11.2% with EBITDA margin increased from 47.8% to 52.8%. While at the bottom line, net income increased by 11.5% to Rp20.8 trillion with a better net income margin at 15.2% from 13.8% last year. IndiHome continued to become the engine of growth as it contributed Rp22.2 trillion, grew by 21.2% with contribution to consolidated revenue increased to 16% from 14% last year. Moreover, EBITDA margin of IndiHome reached 38.9%, a significant increase from 33.9% last year. IndiHome revenue growth was a result of increasing subscribers coupled with improving ARPU. Total subscribers grew by 14.5% to reach 8 million while ARPU in fourth quarter improved to Rp262,000 compared to Rp253,000 in the previous quarter. Increasing ARPU was largely helped by revenue from ads-on that grew by 27.8% and contributed to around 14.7% to IndiHome revenue compared to 13.6% in the same period last year. Ladies and gentlemen, for the enterprise segment, although it declined by 5.2% year-on-year, it showed significant improvement during the year which was mainly due to the success of the new strategy to reduce low-margin business and focus on more profitable products along with various efforts to get quality revenues. Enterprise segment will continue to strengthen the fundamental with focus on connectivity, data center, and cloud, and application services that blended into various enterprise solutions. With a powerful fundamental, we expect enterprise segment to become our next engine of growth in the foreseeable future. Ladies and gentlemen, in the year of 2020, wholesale and international business segment successfully performed with revenue grew by 27.3% year-on-year to Rp13.5 trillion. The growth was basically generated from domestic business such as tower business due to inorganic activities and increasing A2BSMS due to the pandemic, while the international business also has shown good performance driven by overseas wholesale voice, data service, and digital business. The rest data center contributes to a promising growth for both domestic and international markets. Ladies and gentlemen, our mobile business still faced intense competition and continued declining legacy due to transition from voice and SMS to data. As a result, telecom service revenue declined by 4.4% year-on-year, mainly driven by sub-decrease in voice and SMS. On the other hand, digital business revenue increased by 7% to Rp62.3 trillion and significantly increased its contribution to 71.6% of telecom service revenues compared to 63.9% last year. Digital business revenue growth was driven by data traffic that increased by 43.8%. Telecom will continue to focus on providing the best customer experience rather than promoting unreasonable pricing to support industry healthiness. Therefore, we keep enhancing our network by adding 27.7 thousand 4G IDE devices during the year. We recently obtained 20 megahertz spectrum in 2.3 gigahertz that strengthened our spectrum holding position including for us to prepare 5G technology. In parallel, we also try to find strategic partnerships or collaborations with digital player champions to help accelerate digital transformations. Our diversified business has helped us run the company resiliently when one segment is facing difficult times. The strong performance of fixed line business has successfully compensated our mobile business that was pressured by competition and legacy decline. In the past year, we have seen revenue portion from fixed business increase from 28% to 39% while its net income contribution significantly increased from around 5% to 22% in 2020. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude my remark, let me share our plan guidance for the year of 2021. One, we expect consolidated revenue to grow by around mid-single digit. Two, EBITDA margin is expected to be relatively stable. Three, capital expenditure for the group is expected at around 25% of revenues. That's ending my remark. Thank you. Thank you, President. We will now begin the Q&A session. When raising your questions, please speak clearly and state your name and your company. Operator, can we have the first question, please? Thank you. Just a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star 1 on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound or hash key. Your first question is from Piyush Chowdhury of HSBC. Please ask your question. Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for the call and congrats for the results. Two questions. Firstly, on mobile, can you talk about the competitive dynamics in the industry and outlook for 2021? And has Telkomsel achieved its desired objective after the rollout of unlimited plans last year? Secondly, as you mentioned that you have acquired 20 megahertz in 2.3. Can you share the likely network rollout plans and when do you intend to start offering 5G services using 2.3? Thank you. Hi, Piyush. Rikir here. Can you hear? I'll address your question on competition landscape. So as you pointed out, the last six months or 2020, our product and pricing strategy was intended as a corrective or correction needed to put discipline into the type of industry pricing practices back then. It was necessary for Telkomsel to protect our relative market position. And now we have achieved those objectives in those six to nine months of strategy. However, as the market leader, we always stay focused on driving sustainable growth behaviors in industry. Telkomsel has already initiated price adjustments on the back of microeconomic recovery. We see supportive fiscal stimulation. We see businesses and individuals adapting much better to COVID-19

And with the COVID rollout, all this uplifts the prospects of the pace of economic activity and we see this as a positive outlook. And with this positive outlook and all considerations, we felt the timing was right for us to review our product and pricing away from unlimited and introducing more focus on a BTL, simple and easy to understand offers for existing customers and also introducing more affordable packages in the form of more affordable lower denominations in the areas of acquisitions. However, Telkomsel will continue to monitor closely the behaviours of other operators to avoid and prevent price wars and to have optimum premium gaps whilst protecting relative market position. I think moving forward, looking at the other players in the market, we foresee healthy ARPU and EU recoveries and growth positively. I think overall the industry is much more rational now and let's strive towards sustainable growth as a whole industry. I hope that answers. This is Tian from Telkomsel. Regarding your question about network rollout plan with regard to the 2300 MHz that we won from the auction a few weeks ago. So by having this additional 20 MHz in 2300, now Telkomsel holding 50 MHz in 2300. And it will strengthen our network position in the market. So we will use it both for strengthening our 4G leadership and also preparing for 5G implementation in Indonesia as soon as possible. So as a company, as a leading digital company, we want to remain as the leader in the technology. So we will maximize the usage of this new spectrum to strengthen both 4G and 5G. Sure. But is there a timeline when you're looking to launch 5G services? We will launch it this year. We have some plans. I cannot reveal it exactly now, but in upcoming few months, we will see the launch of the 5G. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll come back in queue. Our next question comes from the line of Arthur Pineda from Citigroup. Please ask your question. Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Two questions, please. First, can we get a better understanding of the growth of Telkomsel into the fourth quarter? You've posted a 4% Q&Q growth for Telkomsel as a group, but when you break down voice, that was down and data was down Q&Q. So it appears that other revenues are driving this. So what is exactly classified on this side? Second question I had is with regard to the outlook for 2021. Are you able to flesh out your mid-single-digit growth guidance across the business lines between fixed, mobile, and enterprise? Thank you. Okay, Arthur. Harry speaking here. Let me try to answer your second question. On the guideline for 2021, basically we have a diversified portfolio. Of course, in the home, we're going to continue to grow. And I think in the enterprise, with regard to the current COVID situation today, which we don't really know where it's going to be benign, I think that's provided with, let's say, low single-digit growth. But our focus is to have more quality, I think, in terms of the customer portfolio and also profitability in this area. And then in the cellular, we see there's still, I think, pressure in the industry until the consolidation really happens. So we put it more, I think, conservative figures. This industry is also going to be, I think, losing a digit growth in the mobile as well. So by having that combination, I think we come to the overall, as my CEO previously mentioned, that we're going to have a low to mid-single-digit growth in revenue overall in our company. That's, I think, a brief explanation to your second question. So for the number one question, actually, the impact for Q4 actually coming from the implementation of the PSK 72, which is related with the IFRS 15. So we do the normalize with the regard of the legacy revenue. On Q, if we have the similar computation, it should be supposed to be, this is based on the last accounting report, it's going to be normalized 5.6. And then if we look at the digital revenue, if it is also normalized, it's going to be increased by 7.3 instead of decreasing 7.1 related with the digital business revenue. Thank you. Okay, so the difference is mainly because of accounting changes, not because of value-added services being booked. So actually because under the IFRS 15, we have to request related with the discount usage. So in the last quarter four, we did the reclassification and proportionate allocate for the legacy revenue and digital business revenue. Thank you. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chong Chen Fung of CIMB. Please ask your question. Hi, thanks for the call. This is Fung from CIMB. Three questions from me. Firstly, on IndieHome, can you talk a bit about competition in this space? And do you see that as potentially posing some risk to your ARPU and also your subscriber targets for 2021? That's the first question. Secondly, for the enterprise business, you mentioned there's still some uncertainties with regards to the impact from COVID-19 and all that. But I wanted to find out, do you expect the enterprise business to be still loss-making this year or do you see a turnaround? And my third question with regards to Telkomsel, how do you see OPEX trending this year, excluding depreciation? Those are my three questions. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Fung. Let me start to answer your question on the IndieHome competitive landscape. Today, even in the same footprint that we have with our competitor, we don't see kind of a very aggressive movement from our competitors. So the competition is quite comparable for us as we have, I think, end-to-end fiber that are much stronger compared to our competitors. On the other hand, with regard to this, actually, regarding the, I think, RPU correction, we don't see that in this moment because as the digitalization coming with, I think, higher speed right now and also more people work from home and study from home, the demand becoming actually stronger. And then many, actually, our customers asking for higher speed of the IndieHome services. This, in addition to some of the, I think, content that we provide also in the home, will give us a kind of comparable situation in terms of the RPU trend in this year. And then in the second question on the enterprise impact of this COVID, as we mentioned to you, that actually we're becoming more, I think, selective in choosing the project, in choosing our client, and also more seeing the profitability also of the business. So we see that actually this business, although still quite low in terms of the profitability, it has already provided profitability business for us. What we do expect, as mentioned also by our CEO, is going to be our future business. As we improve the, I think, profitability, and as I think more enterprise need services from this one, we believe this is going to be next to the IndieHome growth in the future. Number three? So with regard to the cost trending for this year, for 2020, we see the likely decreased combination between OPEX and depreciation. And for this year, 2021, the OPEX related with the revenue and some costs related with the spectrum that we get is going to be increased. And the depreciation is going to be aligned with the additional investment related with our costs in the network and also the power. So it means the trending for OPEX, the sum cost related with the revenue is going to be increased related with the additional of our network. But sum cost related with the digitalization related with how we end up with the impact of

the profit is going to be decreasing. So we also do the managing of the cost related with our network because currently we have the program to simplify our network based on setting our 3G. So perhaps with those kind of activities, the OPEC related of the network can be managed. And we have also scaling in terms of the network capacity. And then we also have the benefit of some of the list tech towers that we are now currently selling the tower because the list tech tower has slightly better compared with the market. So it means the cost still can be manageable. And if it is increased, it's going to be aligned with our revenue and our network. Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone. Next question comes from the line of Krishna Kutabara of Mandiri. Please ask your question. Hi, good afternoon, management. Thanks for the opportunity. I have three questions, actually. So just bear with me. My first question is to Telkomsel. Can we get some update on Telkomsel's capital allocation strategy over the next two to three years? We can see that Telkomsel has monetized its brick and mortar assets such as towers and at the same time invested more heavily into tech platforms such as investments in Gojek, Linkaja, NTMI, and so on. So as Telkomsel recalibrates its asset structure, can we get some color up to how much of Telkomsel's business will actually pivot towards the digital mobile? And perhaps any guidance on the digital CapEx budget for the next two to three years? And what sort of RYC and enterprise valuation impact that Telkomsel seeks to achieve? Second question is to Telkom management as well, similar to the question to Telkomsel. When it comes to digital investments, we understand that some digital investments may not yield as high cash returns as traditional Telkom businesses in the near term. So how should we balance the need to maintain steady cash returns at Telkom level with the need to fulfill Telkom's digital telco strategy and leadership going forward? Just two questions. Thank you. Thank you. So I think from the capital, we have the plan to maintain the percentage of our revenue is going to be around 14% to 15% aligned with the percentage of our revenue. So it means the capital is going to be slightly aligned with our revenue contribution during the next two and three years. And then related with the digital investment, I think Pak Sunam can help for this answer the question, please. Yeah, thank you very much for the question. And clearly I think we continue to look for good and strategic opportunity to invest in growth potential. And I think you highlighted about our investment in Gojek. Yes, we have done our first investment. And so if I may, it has been a good opportunity for us. And in the early day, we have seen good traction among the two companies. We see synergy that we can derive. So moving forward, if we continue to have opportunity like that, we will definitely look at the investment carefully. At the same time, beyond inorganic, we also actively looking at organic growth or digital. We have over the year built up a lot of digital assets. So this will be yet another focus that we will take with regard to digital investment. Bantu, you have anything to add on to that? Yeah, thank you Pak Sunam. Pak Krishna from Mandiri. As an additional information from both Pak Sunam and Pak Sunam mentioned. So as you can see, we are transforming ourselves from telco to become a digital telco. And we show it in terms of how we allocate our capital to invest on the digital. Of course, we hope that by doing this, we will be able to cope with the recent development of the digital world and stay relevant to become more and more close to our customer. And yet we hope that our overall movement on digital initiative will have a positive impact on our valuation multiple later on. That's the overall strategy of that telco. Thank you Pak. Your next question comes from the line of Niko Margaronis of BRI Danareksa. Please ask your question. Thank you. Thank you to management and congratulations I think for the good fourth quarter. Three questions but I think they're straightforward. First of all, you mentioned about EBITDA margins guidance for 2021 to be stable. Can you break it down by business pillar, mobile, indie home and enterprise business? That's my first question. Secondly, how should we think about the consequences from a PSHK 72 in terms of data revenue? So that should mean that going forward there will be some data revenue being allocated under legacy revenue. Is that a fair understanding? That's number two. And number three, in terms of your 5G rollouts, and you mentioned that would be within 2021. Is that going to be for a retail segment or would it be selective rollouts? How do you plan in doing this? Or you're going to be initially focusing on the business segments? Thank you. Thank you, Pak Niko, for your question. I will take the first question. On the EBITDA margin guideline as mentioned by our CEO, are we going to have a kind of stable EBITDA margin? Unfortunately, I cannot provide you too much detail in the parent company on the EBITDA margin per business pillar. But overall, I think what we result in 2020 this year, of course, the next highest EBITDA margin coming from Indie Home, the highest one coming from Telecom Cell. And then from wholesale, as we previously mentioned, we are in the process of improving the enterprise. Enterprise will be the smallest one. Why we cannot provide you so much detail on this one? A lot of actually common assets included in this accounting treatment to really understand on the cost allocation here. I think that's a brief color to you, Pak. Number two related to the PSHK 72, actually for the quarter four, we implement the PSHK 72. So some discount usage previously allocated in the legacy, currently we review and then we proportionate based on the usage distributed to the data. So this is actually the one term that we align with the PSHK 72, the accounting role. And then going forward, it's going to be consistent for us to allocate the discount usage based on the proportionate usage. So the data, the discount usage from data is going to be allocated also proportionate to the data and the legacy is going to be consistent allocated for the legacy. So I think for this year, it's going to be consistent. We implement the PSHK 72. So the impact from the data is not going to be happen like in quarter four. Thank you. Number five. I think he is top up. Let me answer it. Okay. Pak Niko, for the 5G, 5G is a bit different with 4G. 4G is for mass usage. This year for telecom cell 5G will be, we will implement it selectively, not as a mass rollout of network all over Indonesia. It will be selective in certain area and certain condition. And it will be both for B2B and B2C. So as a leader in the technology implementation, telecom cell will always put the good service and leading service to its customer, both for consumer and B2B market. Thank you. Thank you, Pak Sentiyanto. We have another question from the line of Yus Chowdhury of HSBC.

Please ask your question. Yeah, thanks a lot. Three more questions. Firstly, on Indie Home, can you share what is the current home pass and ports as of fiscal 20? And what are the network rollout objectives and subs addition target for 2021? Secondly, you mentioned about synergy benefits with Gojek. Can you give us some examples of how you are able to derive such benefits? And thirdly, on Mitratel, what is the expectation for organic tower and tenancy growth for 2021? Thank you. Okay, for number one, for the home pass in 2020, actually for the home pass in 2020 for the Indie Home is about 24.7 million. And for the port itself, it's about 12.7 million. Sorry, it's not very clear, the voice. Okay. The home pass in 2020, it's about 24.7. That is home pass in 2020 for the Indie Home. And for the port itself, it's about 12.7 million. And the target customer in 2021. Actually, there is still potential subscribers that need connectivity for the household. But in 2021, we will be more selective for this. And we believe we still can add another 1 million subscribers in the home and with some potential additional coming from the fixed wireless access for the new customers. Especially for the area that we have no idea with the infrastructure for the Indie Home. For Babius, let me add some, I think, some color from Bupenus. Basically, what Bupenus mentioned is we expect to have additional about 1 million of the Indie Home, I think regular lines. And also in addition to that, we also do expect we can have fixed wireless access around 500 kilos. So this is going to bring us to around 1.5 million additional in our portfolio. Got it, Pak. BPSIanto from Telkomsel, with regard to your question about synergy benefit from Telkomsel-Gojek investment. So during our first investment, we have several, if I'm not mistaken, 10 strategy synergy initiatives that we plan to implement during the collaboration. And until the first three months, we already launched five collaboration programs. And so far, the result of that collaboration program, synergy value derived from that collaboration program is above what we expect. We can name it, one of it is we create a special package for driver, Gojek driver, special Telkomsel package, data package for Gojek driver. We call it Paket Swadaya. And then we also exchange our MyAds and GoBiz integration, where our merchant and Gojek merchant and Telkomsel outlet can use their advertising together. Basically, Gojek merchant can use Telkomsel digital advertising, things like that. And so far, we see that the collaboration going forward with Gojek is going better and better. And we hope that the synergy value that we plan will achieve more than 100% this year. Thank you. On your third question, Pak Bius, on the Mitratel. As previously mentioned, actually, we are in the preparation for helping IPO for this company. So we triggered to this preparation and the process. Unfortunately, I cannot give you so much color on this one. The only, I think, information that we already provided previously, I think that's the maximum that we can provide with respect to the compliance of the process. I think the tenancy, if you remember, we have around 1.65, our objective, and our plan is to have this Mitratel ready for the IPO by the end of the year, subject to the market condition. I think that's the situation that we have today. Thank you, Pak Kary. Understood. Thank you. We have another question from Nico Margaronis of BRI Danareksa. Please ask your question. Yes, thank you. I would like to pick up on the Gojek collaboration and some news that I found in the Bloomberg terminal that you're considering of increasing your investment in Gojek. Could you provide some more color on this, and what do you expect to achieve by increasing your stake in Gojek? Thank you. Nico, from Telkomsel. Yes, as you may aware, we invest in Gojek, and we have a plan to continue to invest and collaborate with them. Of course, as a strategic investor, one of the main purpose of investment is to get the synergy value between us and them. So we hope that in the upcoming future, with the recent development in Gojek, we will increase our collaboration, so both parties will derive synergy value from the synergy collaboration that will happen. And also, as an investment, we also hope that we can get a capital gain from our investment. So it will be both sides. Number one is in terms of synergy value that we can derive, and the second one is from the capital gain that we invest. Right, right. Thank you, Pak Setianto. If I may, can I have a second question with regards to corporate actions? You mentioned about Mitratel deadline timeline towards the end of the year for going IPO. I also picked up news about data center business going IPO by the Telkom Group. Could you provide also some color on this? Thank you. On the data center, what we are building now is, as we call it as a hyperdata center, it's a first data center, it's in the east of Jakarta, basically. And it should be ready probably in the first quarter of this year. And we also actually as part of the data center, we are also currently have been deploying what we call as a X data center throughout the country. Now we have 32

toward the country. Now we have 32 locations, but we plan to enter some more locations that will support the hyperscale center. So for the IPO, I think we plan to consolidate the data center first, and then we look at the IPO probably sometime in early 2023. So let me confirm late 23 you mentioned. So basically we have some data centers just under our subsidiary Sigma and also in Telecom International and parent company as well. We're going to consolidate all the data centers and including the potential for future development. As mentioned also by Pak Riri, one still in the progressing of the hyperscale. And this also I think we also potentially will invite somebody else also who can bring technology, bring market and so on to come to Indonesia as well in the partnership. Later on when we this already, as mentioned before, we may come to the market in 2023, for example. Thank you very clear. Thank you Pak Hari. There are no further questions from the line at this time. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.

 T signal in operator by pressing star, then zero.
 Please note that this call is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremiah or Poku.
 Please go ahead, sir.
 Good afternoon, everyone.
 and thank you for joining us today

 with that over to you Salam.
 Thank you, Jeremiah. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for making time to join us on this call today
 I will provide a brief overview of our performance for the year ending December 2019.
 and speak a little bit about the outlook for this year, 2020.
 It's 400 over to the operator for questions and answers.
 We're excited by the strong performance delivered
 by M.T. and Ghana, the team here for the year 2019,
 in a competitive industry while maintaining market leadership with 55% market share.
 We grew 7.3% here and here, driven by strong growth in voice, data, and mobile language.
 Voice Revenue was up in the double digits and increased by 19% year-on-year.
 supported by growth, you know, after subscriber base,
 continued improvements to our network and the impact of various customer value
 management initiatives, and pro-customer activity, which
 increase the usage of our services by our customers.
 The contribution of voice revenue to overall revenue ashes down from 45 to 45 percent from 46 percent.
 As expected, as the new lines of revenue continue to grow faster than the traditional voice business.
 Data revenue growth was strong that 53% year on year and was attributable to the higher number of active data
 to subscribe us and smart phone users on the network.
 as well as an increase in data usage
 across our customer base.
 Data contributor 28% to total service revenue.
 up from 26% in 2018.
 Model money revenue also contributed on a strong tip
 on the strong trajectory,
 by 28% in a year in which we marked its 10th anniversary in Ghana.
 The growth in mobile money was driven by the outgoing expansion in the number of active
 subscribers and increased transactional activity, as well as good growth in advanced services
 which has retail matching payments, pensions,
 remittances, as examples.
 MoloMoney made up 19% of the overall service revenue,
 compared to 18% in the prior year.
 Turning to EBITDA for earnings before interest tax
 to precision energization.
 This grew by 66% with a year-on-year ever-than-margin expansion
 of 13 percentage points to 51% on a reported IFRS view.
 When comparing on a like-for-like IAS 17 basis,
 how ever the margin increased by 4.8 percentage points to 42.5 percent.
 If we further normalize for management fee, then like to like even the margin expanded
 by 5.9 percentage points to 43.5 percent.
 The margin improvement was supported by tight controls and appropriate expenses, as well
 distribution efficiencies. In terms of cupics, we invested 1.1 billion
 in support of the growth in the core business and improving the participation in quality
 of service to our customers.
 M.T. Ghanak acknowledges the outbreak of coronavirus worldwide and its potential impact on our
 supply chain. While we monitor unfolding developments, we're
 exploring multiple scenarios and a bit to mitigate the impact on our business.
 On the regulatory front, the Payments Systems and Services Act 2019 was passed in May last
 year into law. This governs the way mobile money services are conducted. As required
 of existing players such as us.
 We have duly applied for the new license.
 MTM Gannam maintains ongoing engagements with regulatory stakeholders with a firm focus
 of sustaining cordial relationships and achieving continued improvements in customer experience.
 Following the expiry of certain technology licenses in 2019, the NCAL regulator has renewed
 our 2G license for 15 years. We have submitted applications for the renewal of our international
 gateway and fixed access licenses, which are pending NCR approval.
 We continue to invest in our communities with the MTN Ghana Foundation and support recent
 in a total of one 49 projects since inception in 2007.
 2019, the foundation initiated eight new projects in education, three in health and one in economic
 Empowerment.
 The Board declared an interim dividend of Â£2.00 per share after reviewing the media
 performance of the company.
 After reviewing the full year performance of the company, the board shall be recommending
 a final dividend of $4.00 per share, bringing the total dividend for 2019 to $6.00 per share.
 This represents 73% of profit after tax and a 20% increase in dividend to share.
 Before I comment briefly on prospects for the outlook, I would like to take this opportunity
 to highlight some changes in our management, which Jeremia pushed on a little earlier.
 As you may be aware, from our release to the market last week, our CFO, Modipha Kadri,
 and an executive director of MTN Ghana has been appointed to the chief financial officer
 Executive Director Rule of Empty and Nigeria Effectives, 1st March 2020.
 As a result, Cognac Ben-Tienchel has been appointed to act as Chief Financial Officer until the replacement process is completed.
 This process is underway and we'll update the market once finalized.
 On this note, I would like to wish both gentlemen the very best in their new roles.
 In terms of the outlook for 2019, mark the year of the customer for MTN Ghana, and in
 In 2020, we're building on that foundation as we transition from a traditional mobile
 telecoms operator to an emerging digital operator.
 As a business, we're well-positioned for continued growth as we invest in ongoing improvements
 in quality of service and a drive to increase the participation of Ganyan and all our services
 offerings. In line with our transition journey, MT & Ghana has declared 2020 as the year of
 the customer the digital experience with a firm focus on digital the focus on
 I'm going to tell you the tools to enhance customer experience, as well as create value
 for our shareholders.
 At this point I would like to hand over the conference call to the operator for questions
 and answers.
 Thank you very much once again.
 If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your touchtone phone or on the keypad on your screen
 If you decide to withdraw the question, please press star then 2 to remove yourself from the list.
 Again, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press star, then 1.
 We will pause to see if there are any questions.
 We have a question from Mangaliso Tiamini from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
 Hi everyone, this is Mali Sollamini from JPMorgan.
 Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.
 uh... two questions from my side
 uh...
 One relates to the 2G license renewal.
 Could you provide some color as to how much the renewal cost, please?
 Secondly, on the mobile money services, with the change in legislation and application for
 new license? Is this a simple administrative tick in the box or is there more to the process?
 Could you maybe just talk us through the process there, please?
 Thank you.
 Well, thank you very much for the question.
 And let me start with the 2G license.
 And the 2G license was renewed at twenty five million dollars.
 This was an industry renewal, and both ourselves and Vodafone have this renewal, and the validity
 or the tenure of the license was 15 years.
 In terms of the license, I think it is a good idea to have the license.
 off of the MOMO process, the new act, the PSSA Payment Systems and Services Act.
 And I believe the question was whether this was an administrative
 taking the box for the regulator or whether there was something else behind it.
 I think the spirit behind the PSSA two or three things here and the first one is in
 In 2014, there was the EMI, which was the Electronic Money Issuer
 regulation that was passed, which allowed
 I tell Coast to take more responsibility in managing agents and accounting for customers
 as a customer of the more money operator.
 before that it was actually banned to live fully.
 and therefore those assets were essentially owned by the banks.
 The PSSE is intended to expand on this by allowing FinTech, the broader FinTech community,
 beyond the moral money operators, to also have a framework under which they operate.
 That being said, and that allows some sort of regulation and oversight for the FinTech
 community that has an impact on the mobile money industry overall.
 But then the second thing was also, after the banking sector clean up, was also to institute certain mechanisms that allow risk to be managed in a structured format, so that we can prevent a similar situation from happening within the mobile money or the fintech space.
 central bank themselves with a growth in more money over the last three to five years and
 about to update your own internal processes for better
 and on the spine of this space.
 So this will be the three main drivers.
 and but certainly a positive framework from our perspective
 in terms of enabling the environment
 and looking out for a future that's going to continue
 to be dominated essentially by the mobile financial sectors
 of the Sintek companies in terms of how we manage financial services overall.
 Thank you.
 Our next question is from Prasindran Udayar from Nedbank. Please go ahead.
 Hi, everyone.
 And it's presented here.
 just following up on Magalitha's question.
 So it sounds like, yes, that this neural act is more
 But do you as management see any roadblocks in terms of actually getting this license
 So is it something that you've kind of like pieced in?
 And a second question on the regulatory front was,
 I read somewhere that in December you did get fined by the regulator for service disruptions.
 Can you give us an update on that,
 Has that all been resolved?
 Is it a one-soft thing or something
 that we can expect more?
 Thanks.
 Thanks for your question.
 And I'll take the first question which was on the risks or any potential risks of getting
 the license.
 naturally foresee that to be a major constraint. Obviously, we have to also be diligent in
 our submission, which we have done. But we don't see any major roadblocks from where
 it sits at this stage. And the process will end in June. And, you know, there are any
 changes would update you through that, but we certainly don't see any risks from out
 In terms of your second question, which is about the sign and whether that's a sign
 but that's all being resolved.
 yes
 We received a fine for 100,000 Ghana CDs in December following the implementation of
 of new services, and that situation was resolved within 48 hours of us receiving the fine.
 I don't believe that we can expect any other fines in terms of the business.
 Okay, sorry.
 So the time was 100,000 CD in total.
 It wasn't plus subscribe or anything like that.
 No, it's 100,000 in total, that's correct, yes.
 Okay, now thank you very much.
 The next question is from Moses Zawul from Bloomberg.
 Please go ahead.
 All right, thank you very much.
 My question is now telecoms are moving closer to higher Gs.
 Why would you still want to renew your 2G license?
 That's my first question.
 My second question, are you indicated that there is potential for the coronavirus to impact your supply chain?
 Please give us some more details.
 have you started getting any sort of impact, and if you talk about potential in what form
 could it become serious?
 Thank you.
 Thanks for the question in terms of the 2g license and why we thought it was important to renew it
 I'm just to give you some context.
 Today we have approximately 40% smartphones on our network, which means we have 60% of
 of our users today that do not have a smartphone
 and rely on 2G services.
 Now, as much as, you know, smart phone users have a higher output, you know, the 60 percent
 on a lower app with a very significant component of the business.
 You know, we really have no option if we have to continue to grow the business forward to renew the 2G license.
 However, we're also expecting that in the next couple of years, we should see universal
 access license implemented by the regulator, which would mean that we can re-appropriate
 the nine hundred and eight hundred spectrum under the two g
 for higher generations of technology.
 So we have that in mind when we're looking at the renewal.
 But we definitely didn't have much of a choice for the renewal since we have a huge dependency
 on 2G currently in terms of our base and the mix of smart phones.
 In terms of the coronavirus, you know, our measures to be proactive and were basically
 preempt him a potential situation down the line. So we haven't had any impact in the
 business currently.
 But in anticipation of what may happen, we're making sure we put in place the right processes
 to prevent any impact on the business going forward.
 The next question is from Jake Ward from Ashmore Group. Please go ahead.
 Alright, thanks for the call guys.
 A couple of questions if I may. Firstly, given the strong growth in the voice output, I wondered
 I wonder if you could just expand a bit more on some of the initiatives that have driven
 and your expectations for the business in 2020.
 Secondly, despite the strong year on year growth, it looks like the mobile money revenue
 It came in just a little bit softer in Q4,
 based on our numbers.
 Can you just give some color on what Joe's at?
 Thanks.
 All right. Thanks for the question. And the first one, I'll take the first one, which is around the Voice app,
 what the expectations are for 2020 and some of the initiatives that support the voice
 business. So we see the voice business as a business that's gone from being the most
 significant business to now and a business that we're managing forward and so by that
 That's where minimizing our above the line campaigns in terms of voice and doing a lot
 of below-the-line campaigns, which takes us into an area called Customer Value Management,
 And so what we basically do in terms of voice is to look at profiles of customers and try
 to define specific products and services, that's due to the specific behavior based
 on the characteristics and the attributes of that particular segment or that particular
 I use that.
 So this has been, I would say, the primary mechanism
 to manage voice in order not to impact the growth in some of the newer areas which would
 be mixes between voice and data users.
 In terms of the expectations for 2020,
 We have a very strong desire to continue to drive smartphone growth, so we will expect
 to see the mix of smart phone and non-smart phone changing in favor of smart phones.
 However, with the rate we've seen historically, we won't suddenly change the baseline for
 for the non-smartphone users and would expect to see a reduction in that base, but continue
 will still be significant and strong. As such, the activities on CVM will continue, but the
 The focus to drive growth and secure the future of business will be largely driven by the
 smart home base, what we're doing in terms of apps, my empty and music apps and gaming
 and things like that, as well as the enhancement and customer experience to ensure that you
 you can drive more transactional activity.
 So that would really be the focus for 2020.
 In terms of the more performance, there were some changes in Q4 which impacted the year-on-year
 revenue growth and the most significant of which is part of that the PSSA meant that
 that there was a change in how the interest revenue on mummofloats was distributed and
 And that change would have given us an additional, so without that change we would have seen
 an additional 10% fish point growth in Momo.
 So that's the primary driver of the drug.
 And the organic business continues to be very strong.
 to continue to see that growth in 2020.
 That's great. Thank you very much.
 The next question is from Joyce Agboizel from Data Bank Brokeage Limited. Please go ahead.
 Hi, thank you very much for this call.
 My question relates to the cost efficiencies that I see in the business, so looking at the
 current figures that were posted.
 And this is that the costs declined or reduced significantly for some of the major cost items.
 Johnson knew what drove that.
 Thanks for the question.
 them, would you place on the line and you would respond to that and the costs?
 Right.
 Hello.
 So thanks for the question.
 The cost efficiency is mainly on both fronts on the cost of sales.
 So we were able to optimize our relationship
 international careers, so we had a lot of savings on incoming international
 calls. And then on the OPEC side, we also had some of my visions reviewed various contracts
 that we had with service providers and leverage on our sites.
 So physically what we've done is to optimally continue to try to optimize our operations
 such that networks and ideas are going forward.
 And you're going to see much of that in the coming period, too, to continue that.
 All right, thank you very much
 The next question is from Flores Sienkamp from Coronation.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi there. I also have a question on the payment license.
 I mean, you briefly mentioned the changes in Q4, but I was just wondering, what are the
 the main changes for your business under the new license.
 I mean, any services now that you can offer or can't offer,
 You know all.
 that you can charge and not charge
 just the main changes for the business.
 And then secondly also on the, what are the costs involved?
 involved, if they are one sort of licensed fee or an annual cost related to this.
 And then lastly, there were talks in the past of a 30% local ownership requirement for mobile
 many businesses and I'd just like to hear your thoughts on what's the latest on this
 And does this new license address that at all,
 or is there still something that's a bit of an issue?
 Thanks.
 Okay, thanks for the question.
 So just very quickly on the first part, which is what
 where the main changes.
 So the two significant changes in terms of the business, and mind you the cold business
 and continues to run.
 There are no significant changes or no changes at all
 on the core business.
 However, in terms of the interest on float, that's where the changes happen.
 So before the changes in Q4,
 the float interest was split 80-20.
 what 20 goes to the operator like us and 80 goes to the customer.
 The changes there have been a reduction to the operator, so it's no longer 20% to the
 the operator is now 10% of the operator and 90% of the customer.
 but also what has changed here is the interest
 on float, which is regulated by the central bank.
 That number was 7% prior to Q04 and has been reduced to 4%.
 So the entire interest scheme has changed for the float earnings.
 And so these are the two main changes.
 However, on the operational side, in terms of the products we offer that we've built
 internally, there's no impact on that portfolio at all.
 In terms of the 30% low cost,
 ownership.
 The PSOC has clarified the 30% ownership now, which is, in terms of 30%, it's measured
 on the capital required to get the license.
 So for us to be a dedicated EMI, which is called a Demi, D-E-M-I,
 and we need a minimum capital requirement
 of 20 million Ghana cities.
 the local ownership is thirty percent
 of that 20 million capital required, which is the 6 million Ghana CDs for us.
 process now to finalize that, but it's a pretty straightforward activity now and then what
 what had been suggested in the past.
 Our next question is from Douglas Holm from Decan. Please go ahead.
 Hi guys, thanks for the call.
 I was wondering if you could just give us what the Momo and Digital Revenues were for
 for 2018 and 2019?
 Okay, um, just bear with me one second.
 So,
 So total voice revenue, and I don't know if I got the last one, but total voice revenue
 was $2.318 billion, Ghana cities, and data revenue is $1.461 and mobile money revenue
 is $9.59 million.
 And what about the other digital revenue?
 revenue, just bear it as one second, if that's not in the $199 million in terms of digital
 revenue.
 Okay, and then it looks like Momo was down about 23% in the fourth quarter.
 Is that what you guys have as well?
 because we're trying to back into a fourth quarter number here.
 There was a question earlier on what drove the change in the MOMO trend from Q3 to Q4,
 And it allows you to change in the interest scheme, both on the float interest and the
 split between customers and operators.
 breaches.
 Right, so I guess the business, the peer-to-peer payments, the transactional payments,
 Can you give us an idea of how much that grew
 you on here.
 So, most of the key lines, I mean, the more money drivers would be cash out revenue as
 as well as peer-to-peer revenue,
 Hashtag is about at 60% and peer-to-peer is about 30%.
 And both of those are trained by the same rate as the total thickness of about 28% year
 I don't need a groove.
 And then just in terms of the 30% local ownership requirement,
 You know, 6 million Ghana CDs of ownership, I would assume that the IPO already satisfies
 that requirement.
 So that determination has not been made yet.
 We submitted the application and the central bank is currently reviewing that, so we'll
 get the response to that in due course.
 But yes, the six million in terms of the value of the business, it's quite a small amount.
 We don't expect this to be a hurdle to actually even localization from the perspective of
 And then what was the management fee amount in 2019?
 Okay, so I'll just pass that to you, to Mojufa Tuhando.
 Excuse me.
 The management fee amount was $192 million.
 Okay.
 And then, gotcha.
 And then, in the direct network costs, you know,
 They appear to have fallen year on year, but I believe part of that is just simply moving
 lease costs, operating lease costs out of the direct network
 operating costs so you know I guess is the 624 million if you wanted to look on
 at apples to apples do you add four hundred thirty million for for lease
 You asked for an answer to Milo, that's good.
 Just one last question on kind of the outlook for 2020.
 I mean, can you guys give us some high-level thoughts on revenue growth by the major bucket's
 voice data and
 and, um, and Momo.
 Okay, we don't have that split, but our overall guidance is, you know, we maintain our overall guidance in the prospectus for year three.
 Okay, and what about margins?
 As well with our guidance, we should be tracking our guidance for margins as well.
 Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
 The next question is from Timothy Russook from Frontera Capital.
 Please go ahead.
 Hey guys, this is Ray fun for Tim. I have quite a few questions just starting out with mobile money
 KPIs, a couple that you've mentioned in the past.
 The first one, I was just wondering what transactions
 per user per month looked like for 2019.
 And then, I guess, total amount of remittances as a portion of mobile money revenue or mobile
 money transaction volume, what the yearly transaction value was for the mobile money
 product and then any updates on your subscriber market share.
 All right.
 I don't know if I can answer all of them immediately, but we'll certainly get back to you on the
 one that I missed but let me let me start with the transactions pay you is a
 So the two most popular transactions which will be in line with the revenue splits as
 as well with P2P and cash-out.
 And it's typically five transactions on P2P and five transactions on cash out pay use
 up in money.
 In terms of cashier, and it's very similar to P2P,
 at 4.5 transactions a month.
 And these would be the three main transactions.
 The rest are really small transactions that are continuing to grow,
 we're seeing good growth in mention payments and bill payments for the transaction frequencies
 They're quite small.
 In terms of the update on the subscriber share, just to clarify, is that subscriber share in mobile
 money or is that subscribe I share on the core business yep I would take I would
 Take both subscriber market share numbers, both Momo and the core business.
 I'm more and more in the call business.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 So in terms of our core business market share, we're at 55.2% in terms of the core business
 at the end of 2019.
 In terms of the remittance percent of total revenue, remittance is about 1.6 percent of total revenue.
 And in terms of our mobile money, subscribe or share, we're at about 74% and I believe
 Those will be the questions that you ask.
 Yeah, and then I just had a couple fall ups so one that 74 is
 is last year, you were at 94, right?
 so that's a significant drop.
 I guess what has led to that 20% point change in market share?
 Okay, so just to clarify, the value, the 94% you refer to is actually the share of the total transacted value.
 Okay.
 On that basis, we're still above 90%.
 And the subscriber share has remained about the same in the market place as well.
 So these are two fairly stable numbers despite the 28% growth in the business.
 I hope that clarifies.
 And then did you give a number for yearly transaction value?
 I think I think last year your your transaction value was a hundred and fifty-one or maybe 2017 was a hundred and fifty-one billion CDs
 I don't think I have a 2018 number, but I was wondering what the 2019 transaction value
 was.
 Sure, we'll come back to you on that and we just have to rely on the disclosures by the central bank
 so it's consistent, so we'll come back to you in a minute.
 Okay, sounds good.
 And then...
 last question.
 Well, just seeing the obvious operator split of the interest off the float come down and
 and then the interest rate that's being, you know,
 charged on that, or agreed to in that poll out.
 Is this something we're going to see in another part of the cycle in four or five years and
 Another updated act where that could strip down to, you know, the operators taking no
 I'll share of interest income off of the float, is that where we're headed?
 No, I don't believe we will get to the point where there's no interest for operators.
 And I think this trend was really facilitated by trying to promote more interest back to
 the consumer, which is where the 90% came in.
 In terms of the reduction in the interest rate itself, this is something that we have
 central bank is managing and we've had quite a tough financial industry, there was a restructuring
 last year and so that's all driven by sorry that's the result of some of these
 activities. So I don't expect to see major changes to these numbers going forward, but
 certainly not get into zero interest.
 got it. And then just final question on subscriber growth for mobile money. It looked so active
 data subs were up, I think, nine and a half percent
 for the year and then, all right, active mobile money
 sub drop 4.6% to the year, and then overall mobile money
 were up one. Do you have any view on an acceleration or deceleration subscriber
 numbers and what is the lever you're looking to pull here, sort of converting, the inactive
 subscriber to an active subscriber, or are you further focused on monetizing, I'm going
 the actual subscriber growth kind of, you know, on the back burner now and you're more focused
 on the monetization of what you have,
 or how do you think about that strategically?
 You know, you absolutely need to cross on.
 I mean, last year, there was a bit of a focus on monetization
 and launching more advanced services.
 But certainly we've started this year on an acquisition drive.
 So we should see growth.
 We should see quantitative growth this year as well.
 Got it.
 Awesome, thanks.
 The next question is from Muammar Ismaili from EFG Hermes.
 Please go ahead.
 Yes, thank you, thank you for taking the call.
 So, please, could you name some of the existing partner banks that you're working with on
 the MoMo Wallet.
 That's my first question.
 The second question is, does the Payment Systems and Services Act change the nature of these
 relations?
 Thank you for watching.
 I'll see you in the next video.
 if so, in what way?
 And then my last question is on the reduction in the interest for float.
 That's come down from 7% to 4%.
 Is there a provision in the existing acts that allows for a revision upwards should
 great to know market change. Thank you.
 All right, thanks. I'll have them with the parents of the first two questions, which are around the bank and relationships.
 And then I will take the question on whether we expect, on the provision in the act that
 that can affect the interest rates.
 So I'll start with the provision and now I know what's in the degree after that.
 In terms of the provision, there is no provision in the act itself, and, you know, the fall
 The four and the seven percent are not governed by the act.
 These are more operational tactics by the central bank.
 So there isn't a provision per se.
 However, these are discussions we'll continue to have
 with the central bank on trying to maximize the opportunity with interest going forward.
 I'll hand over to Mojube to handle the question on bank partnerships and the implications.
 Well, as I know, the bank or partner bank has nothing like changed.
 The guidelines doesn't stipulate any changes, so we still maintain the relationships we
 we have with the partner banks and also trying to increase that ecosystem as it was.
 I'm not sure I got to a second question,
 There was a second question, but if there was, please kindly repeat it.
 Yeah, so I'm just asking, I don't know if it's a long list, but if it's a short one,
 Now just asking for you to name the partner banks that you work with on the MoMA wallet.
 We work pretty much with most of the key banks,
 What's in the name, the EcoBank, the GT, the SandShirt, pretty much for the two-percent
 Thank you very much for being here.
 that we're working with.
 Okay, thank you for that.
 The next question is from Nichanand Bhatt from the CanValue Investors.
 Please go ahead.
 Hi, guys. Thanks for the call.
 A quick question to continue this discussion on this float, on the float part of the business.
 Can you give us a sense of the total value of float generated by MOMO during the year
 2019 and how did it grow versus 2018?
 Thank you.
 The float size for MTN was in excess of 3 billion CDs.
 And how they grew up, just trying to get my numbers that come for this out.
 Yeah, so the first few to three, two out of three in the city at the end, is in there.
 And pretty much that would sit on empty and mobile money platform as it was, but like
 Excellent.
 for the officials to go to be published by the central bank.
 I'm going to pretty much bring that line,
 in line with what I've just said.
 OK.
 and get
 Sorry, that's the second thing I just said.
 just trying to get the exact numbers for you.
 So the $3.4 billion as of December 2019 compared to $2.43 billion as of December 2015.
 Got it.
 got it, got it. And typically what is the duration of the float? How long does this
 floats stay in, you know, if you put one hundred Ghana CD on day one, how long before it goes
 goes into the system again.
 It works.
 um
 Okay, so that's why I can answer the question as long as the subscriber has an electronic
 It must be backed by cash, which is a clue.
 So as long as those wallets exist, then the float's most represented by the cache.
 The numbers we talked about, the 3.4 billion series, are the highest value of the electronic
 at the level of the electronic voltage.
 So how long do you think this is going to take?
 It's been the night.
 depends on what some of the things that I'm talking about,
 the transactions, how much you're able to keep within the ecosystem and how much you're
 I can't even catch the time.
 It's consistent.
 But given the numbers we give, then I just
 2.43 billion as of the end of December 2018 compared to 3.4 billion as of 2019, that shows
 that the product is increasing because we've also created different uses
 for the product in terms of what could be used on the ecosystem.
 So you have increase in mashans, mashans payments,
 agent footprint and things like that.
 that actually boosts in the whole mobile money ecosystem.
 Understood, understood.
 and the partnership with the banks, right?
 So, the interest that you get on the float, you said is going to be split 90-10 now, 90
 with the customer and then with you, with Momo.
 How?
 How does the interest rate compare to the deposit rate that the customer would get if
 they
 just put the money in the bank.
 Okay, so two things.
 Finally, for most people, if you think, if you look at the mobile money wallet as a
 our current account where you currently end zero, no interest on your balances on your
 account, then you will look at the mobile money for the next
 best thing because you could end up to 4% or there about all your money, so if you look
 Look at those two, which is the crux for each other basically, that I have your money or
 or into accounts or your mobile money wallet.
 So you have that ability to aim interest on one.
 What else you have?
 no ability to end interest on the other.
 So that's how it compares.
 last party exchange and last party interest rates.
 The interest rates are regulated by the bank, by the central bank, so they are kept low.
 You know, there will be an increased dialogue on that with the industry so that we can get
 more value for the subscribers, but at the moment that's what it is, it's been
 regulated by the central bank, and like you already said, the whole objective is that
 Those flows or those monies belong to the subscribers and as such they should be remitted
 accordingly.
 the New Payment Services Act has tried to do is to codify that in black and white, that's
 90 percent of the money is generated on the floats should be sent to the subscribers and
 That's all I did.
 The next question is from Ali Nasser from Virgin Acid Management.
 Please go ahead.
 All right.
 Thank you for the opportunity to ask questions.
 just to follow on the interest rate structure scheme.
 I'm just curious whether you've seen any change in behavior, perhaps the, you know, the incentive
 and maybe contribute to the wallet today.
 I hear you talk about the difference between the current account and the wallet, but generally speaking, have you seen any change in behavior towards people contributing to the flow via the wallet as a result of the change in interest rates?
 We like the first one, see.
 Right, so if I could take that, I think the two ways you could look at that, one, the
 You may have thought that your float balances are going from 2.43 to 3, over a billion, more
 less in a year, that's about 50 per cent, shows that it's attractive to some.
 So that's one, two.
 Most of the people in the mobile money ecosystem
 those who are actually on the banks who probably could not have access to a bank in accounts.
 So having been brought into the, under the auspices of financial inclusion, obviously
 They would continue to invest in those activities or continue to protect those activities.
 So I'm not sure it would be right for us to compare light for light because these most
 of the both of these, the majority of these people,
 while part of the financial system.
 So I think, you know, as much as the flow start growing,
 due to the activities that people can now do on the mobile wallet.
 I think you're going to see that number potentially increasing.
 At what rates, I can't say.
 But I could definitely say that the interest
 may not be the major driver of why people are coming to the ecosystem.
 It's more of the convenience and what they're able to achieve with having the mobile money
 wanted.
 That's clear. The second question, I think you alluded earlier on in the call to value
 out of services, such as pensions, and things
 that are outside of the P2P transaction type.
 Can you talk about the percentage of value
 percentage of transactions that's coming from value-added type services in the mobile ecosystem?
 And the question was on what was the contribution of the advanced services and mobile money
 Is that correct?
 That's correct, yeah.
 it's about eleven percent
 in terms of the contribution.
 And it takes to say that that 11% carries a higher margin compared to kind of the traditional
 You should be doing it.
 That's correct, yes.
 Because the traditional business has a commission on cash-in, which doesn't apply to this.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you.
 is this on management fees.
 This reminds us that the MCN group charge any management teams on Momo, Revenues, or
 either DAF.
 I just wanted to get a sense of that.
 Well, by the time we submitted the application to the GIPC,
 All of the company revenues was the intent and that was what the guys are giving.
 So the manoeuvres is actually for all services, bear in mind that even the platforms with
 The mobile money platform is supported by group technical and stuff like that, so that's
 the concept.
 when we actually applied for the financial approval to total revenues, which included
 be the new stems from what is now more than money limited.
 Okay, so just confirm it doesn't include mobile money.
 So, what other questions?
 But I just wanted to confirm
 You're saying that the management fee would include revenue from mobile money from Momo
 Yes.
 As a time when we submitted the application, that was what's approved for.
 Okay.
 And those monitoring speeds have been charged
 and have been remitted up to the group?
 Yes, they've been charged and they've been...
 Those are the LF figures we quoted and they've been charged into the Indian Information
 I just said great, thank you guys.
 The next question is from Binta Draves from Blakeney. Please go ahead.
 Thank you guys for the presentation and the time for the call.
 I just wanted to quickly ask you in terms of for the merchant payment and merchant agent,
 agency network, what's the evolution year on year?
 And the second question is regarding the impact of the changes in regulation, the new PSA Act,
 That's the impact of this on the Q4 mobile revenue.
 What should we expect for the full year 2020?
 do you think some of those changes will be offset
 by increased usage or do you see an impact coming through in 2020?
 to train to.
 Okay, so let me answer the second question first and then we'll come back to the first question.
 So in terms of the changes between them, we'll expect to continue to see strong growth in
 mobile money on the revenue line and the focus really on mobile money is to continue to drive
 met on payments and wished to base about 2% of the total revenue but we should see that
 that continue to grow as we gain more merchants.
 In terms of the year-on-year, we ended last year with about 80,000 merchants and we finished
 Sorry, we ended 2018 with about 80,000 merchants and we finished 2019 at about 100, over 100,000 merchants.
 So we should see good growth this year as well in terms of merchant services.
 And more importantly, we should see an increase in the transaction per mention with a mention
 that we newly onboarded last year.
 So we'd expect some good growth, some good growth from that.
 Okay.
 The final question is from kin alol from is is in it please go ahead
 Hello, thank you for the opportunity and congratulations on your performance.
 I see a lot of the banks not coming up with their Momo business, and I want to find out
 But if from your projections, how far would these bank businesses affect your MoMo business?
 Thank you.
 Sure, thanks for the question, and I think it's too early to tell, but if I just sort
 of take, you know, an industry perspective where the more money industry is still, you
 very, very young. The opportunities for transactional activity is massive.
 If you look at the staff that I gave to an earlier question,
 I mean, customers are doing five P2P's per user per month currently.
 and about five kashals per month per user.
 i mean that's a very low number we should expect that
 You know, and it's a mature state.
 you should expect 20 to 30 transactions per user per month.
 On the basis of that, I think, you know, having new entrants in the market, please, and that
 can allow customers to get more used and comfortable to digital currency will continue to help
 the industry and the ecosystem continue to expand.
 So at this stage, it's very difficult to tell the direct
 impact on us as a business, but I do think that as an industry, we should expect the
 industry to continue to expand quite rapidly, the more the players come in and help us develop
 of the ecosystem.
 Is there a Maya? We have no further questions.
 Okay. Thank you once again for making time for today's call.
 If there are any further unanswered questions, please contact me after the call and I'll

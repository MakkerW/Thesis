gonna,operations uh we do expect some of that cost is gonna come back right so um you know i d say,we do expect some of that cost is going to come back right so you know i d say it,
gonna,quite interesting in the future and i think it s gonna help us inject more brain and talent uh remotely with,quite interesting in the future and i think it s going to help help us inject more brain and talent,
gonna,significantly down so now so the the pain we re gonna take in the second half i think is not going,also in the past on the fact that we re in it for the long haul and i think it,
gonna,t think we need the money so we re not gonna to pay a lot of uh interest for it yeah,of reduction i think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward so yeah,
gonna,the end of the day so i hope it s gonna be uh it s gonna materialize into and the older,the end of the day it s a call that we have to make it jointly with them as i,
gonna,so i hope it s gonna be uh it s gonna materialize into and the older book we have is going,business in our space that are going to be quite interesting in the future and i think it s going,

gonna,s premature really to say what we think uh is gonna happen cause i think you have an election in four,soon to tell michael i think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election and is,
gonna,what happens post the election in terms of what s gonna be uh uh the policy when inaudible going for great,what happens in the election and is there continued split government or is there not split government and what we,
gonna,battery storage business secondly uh you know clearly were not gonna backward integrate into manufacturing uh electrolizers or anything like that,the battery storage business secondly clearly we re not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzes or anything like that,
gonna,than us to take advantage of that and we re gonna be just like we were on battery storage we re,than us to take advantage of that and we re going to be just like we were in battery storage,
gonna,be just like we were on battery storage we re gonna be at the vanguard we re gonna uh and we,be just like we were in battery storage we re going to be at the vanguard and this is a,
gonna,storage we re gonna be at the vanguard we re gonna uh and we re gonna this is a big strategic,like we were in battery storage we re going to be at the vanguard and this is a big strategic,
gonna,at the vanguard we re gonna uh and we re gonna this is a big strategic initiative for us and we,battery storage we re going to be at the vanguard and this is a big strategic initiative for us and,
gonna,is a big strategic initiative for us and we re gonna drive it and uh it s gonna be very important,big strategic initiative for us and we re going to drive it and it s going to be very important,
gonna,and we re gonna drive it and uh it s gonna be very important uh for this company i think not,and we re going to drive it and it s going to be very important for this company in the,
gonna,is what it is and uh so it s probably gonna take a bit to get past that before uh i,in that today there s natural gas making it you know imperative that you find a cheap electricity supply you,
gonna,our innovation um our commitment to continuous improvement and were gonna do the best we can to to create the best,innovation our commitment to continuous improvement and we re going to do the best we can to create the best,

gonna,i just have two on my side first one is gonna be on on the guidance do you still stick to,taking our questions i just had two on my side first one is on the guidance to still speak to,
gonna,of uh all our infrastructure and um we re not gonna get take i mean um wrong decisions in terms of,dive in terms of all our infrastructure we re not going to take i mean rough decisions in terms of,
gonna,that s why the the the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well and is going to be managed um or,that s why the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well behaving in a nice in a nice in a,
gonna,these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is gonna take i mean it s probably gonna take down some,these particular situations and depend how long the crisis is going to take i mean it s probably going to,
gonna,the crisis is gonna take i mean it s probably gonna take down some financial players i mean that since we,the crisis is going to take i mean it s probably going to take down some financial payers and in,
gonna,their position is and their situation um and we re gonna basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to,and reviewing and having conversations with them about what their position is and their situation as the crisis continues to,
gonna,there will be lumpiness as we go forward we re gonna move on to some questions on phosphate uh this one,but recognize that there will be lumpiness we re going to move on to some questions on phosphate this one,
gonna,is political and that s really going that candle is gonna get lit um here right around labor day and run,political and that s really going that candle is going to get lit here right around labor day and run,
gonna,that um your comment on carriage we know it s gonna be self funding obviously you have plans to kind of,that your comment on carriage we know it s going to be self funding i ll speak first to wgn,
gonna,t say it s down four greg i m not gonna give the exact number i ve already said that it,t say it s down four craig i m not going to give the exact number i ve already said,
gonna,re not giving guidance right i do i it s gonna be down again well tell us what july was how,not giving guidance right it s going to be down how much july was down if you would i think,
gonna,told you it was down less again i m not gonna give specific numbers uh but it july was down less,think i told you it was down less numbers but july was down less than june and june was obviously,
gonna,and flooding and those kinds of things and those are gonna be more you know temporary disruptors to businesses until they,new york and flooding and those kinds of things and those are going to be more temporary disruptors it s,
gonna,to mid fives is is where on average those are gonna be um are you nick i guess i guess i,low to mid fives is where on average those are going to be are you i guess i guess okay,
gonna,you know i think that s where if we are gonna go off campus that s where you think we will,think that s where if we are going to go off campus that s where you think we will do,
gonna,s going on now um obviously like everyone we re gonna be watching all the trends we re not heavily exposed,s going on now obviously like everyone we re gonna be watching all the trends area which we like as,
gonna,the capital the resources but you know again we re gonna probably stick to you as you you would know us,said have the capital and the resources but again we re going to probably stick to as you would know,
gonna,off so we re okay with that it s still gonna skew that way towards on an on an adjacent though,around 25 off so we re okay with that on an adjacent though and then lastly like maybe for chris,
gonna,protecting that inpatient capacity so i do think you re gonna see a little bit of that we do have to,protecting that inpatient capacity so i do think you re gonna see a little bit of that we do have,
gonna,all down the way it was early on it s gonna be much more targeted and you know i m i,it all down the way it was early on it s going to be much more targeted and you know,
gonna,and i think it s what you said you re gonna it s it s a classic you know problem that,mean i think maybe what s in your question too sort of you know are we preparing for something bigger,
gonna,crises just like the financial crisis caused the strong are gonna get stronger the weak are gonna get weaker and there,mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be a,
gonna,caused the strong are gonna get stronger the weak are gonna get weaker and there s different dynamics to that but,cap rates for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it,
gonna,more more urban uh versus in suburban versus rural is gonna be a huge trend i know that that the trend,and that s fine that s a very real thing and not to say that trend s not real but,
gonna,think those strong um you know population growth centers are gonna be where you re gonna see the success and so,for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be,
gonna,know population growth centers are gonna be where you re gonna see the success and so i do think you are,for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be,
gonna,and i think the acuity level of hospitals is only gonna continue to climb and you re gonna see acuity level,and i think the acuity level of hospitals is only going to continue to climb and you re on and,
gonna,hospitals is only gonna continue to climb and you re gonna see acuity level with outpatient climb both on and off,level of hospitals is only going to continue to climb and you re on and off campus it s a,
gonna,about cap rates for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it,about cap rates for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those,
gonna,mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be a little,mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be a,
gonna,all afcs but in hospitals so i think you re gonna see a more targeted approach um rather than the sort,think you re gonna see a little bit of that we do have to brace for that in terms of,
gonna,be quite as financially difficult um you know is it gonna be tough yeah just like school schools for a lot,quite as financially difficult you know is it going to be tough yeah just like schools schools for a lot,
gonna,lot of us you know with kids and it s gonna be tough you know as soon as they shut down,us you know with kids and it s going to be tough you know as soon as they shut down,
gonna,you re lucky if they re open so there s gonna be ebbs and flows as i mentioned in my remarks,lucky if they re open so there s going to be ebbs and flows as i mentioned in my remarks,
gonna,easy but it it i don t think it s gonna be as bad as it was and and i it,will be not easy but i don t think it s gonna be as bad as it was and it,
gonna,to go up but there is a pocket that s gonna be reluctant at least in the us to go back,go up pocket that s going to be reluctant at least in the u s to go back for a,
gonna,office back to you know close to normal that s gonna take a little bit of time i i think we,office back to you know close to normal that s going to take a little bit of time i think,
gonna,uh we don t know how long the office is gonna be closed uh you know we we re gonna stop,we don t know how long the office is going to be closed you know we re going to stop,
gonna,is gonna be closed uh you know we we re gonna stop uh building inventory on the daily stuff and as,office is going to be closed you know we re going to stop building inventory on the daily stuff and,
gonna,revenue s down 20 in uh 2021 that s obviously gonna have an impact on the business we don t think,taking steps toward margin accretion and as we get out of the traditional ortho business we got out of the,
gonna,impact on the business we don t think that s gonna happen but we re taking specific steps now to sit,and hey look don t think that s going to happen but we are taking specific steps now to sit,
gonna,accretion going forward uh a and and i m not gonna say it s gonna be revenue independent but we think,accretion going forward and i m not going to say it s going to be revenue independent but we think,
gonna,a and and i m not gonna say it s gonna be revenue independent but we think we can take steps,i m not going to say it s going to be revenue independent but we think we can take steps,
gonna,a at a certain revenue base that we re really gonna be able to drive margin and you know we we,at a certain revenue base that we re really going to be able to drive margin we were very clear,
gonna,a is attainable we don t know if it s gonna happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we re,think 22 is attainable know if it s going to happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we re,
gonna,the piece that actually came with your metrics acquisition is gonna stay with that and then you know what we re,the piece that actually came with your metrics acquisition is going to stay with that the 1ds program and we,
gonna,look going forward we didn t feel that there were gonna be dissynergies associated with getting out of traditional uh y,look going forward we didn t feel that there were going to be disenergies associated with getting out of traditional,
gonna,whether it s spread e across you know are we gonna see treatment centers and and are we gonna see imaging,likely to visit in you know the next 30 days the next quarter and whatnot so we ve been seeing,
gonna,are we gonna see treatment centers and and are we gonna see imaging not sure but we we feel very good,results we re seeing and as we go into you know kind of our installed base we feel very good,
gonna,the opportunity for dentists who are you know b basically gonna be dealing with the patient population that may be a,the dsos or the individual dentists are going to be doing is they re really going to be evaluating their,
gonna,you know the worst case scenario and obviously we re gonna work to improve that um but but again uh the,you know the base case and we re going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the,

gonna,know we we think the demand you know is it gonna gyrate a little bit as we recover from the pi,so we think that demand you know is it going to gyrate a little bit as we recover from the,
gonna,a solid number two in the space and we re gonna work toward that um so you you know can do,gave you represent you know the base case and we re going to work hard to improve versus that and,
gonna,and belief is that the clear aligner space is is gonna be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over,belief is that the clear liner space is going to be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over,

uh,of the things we commented on was just we saw uh some inflationary pricing on i ll say the top end,one of the things we commented on was just and i think as you saw and we ve made the,
uh,top end of the product category with more premium brands uh and the first part of the the second quarter we,it falls into three primary buckets related to that the first is non capital items that we send to the,
uh,remarks we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across uh all all price points uh relative to that point in,remarks we certainly don t like talking about the weather brian but we can t ignore the fact that when,
uh,about pricing moving up across uh all all price points uh relative to that point in q3 i think our expectation,get to that down 2 so that s the dynamic at the midpoint so there is an expectation of a,

uh,pretty significantly in vietnam for our upholstery curtain full kits uh that s performing well uh haiti you know we started,pretty significantly in vietnam for our full stream cut and flow kits and that s performing well we re just,
uh,our upholstery curtain full kits uh that s performing well uh haiti you know we started a a two pronged strategy,our full stream cut and flow kits and that s performing well we re just building some extra space and,
uh,rollout and emergency recovery platform that works well for us uh haiti is a a very low cost opportunity that we,you are one to ask a question we ll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to,
uh,opportunity that we see um out on a near sourcing uh potential so we re able to drive uh significantly faster,time that will get better but it s a pretty long fight for someone like us to make a big,
uh,near sourcing uh potential so we re able to drive uh significantly faster lead times in haiti it s been a,get out of the longer lead times that we ve had recently those lead times down so we re not,

uh,have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components uh lead times have gotten a little longer so we ve,have gotten more diverse with imported mattresses and imported components the lead times have gotten a little longer our platform,
uh,extra inventory yeah marco this is ken and that s uh we had you know the extra inventory we we were,our exposure for extra inventory yeah marco this can and that s you know the extra inventory we we were,
uh,we build up inventory that those sales didn t material uh didn t materialize but now with this new focus uh,we built up inventory that those cells didn t materialize but now with this new focused we should be able,
uh,uh didn t materialize but now with this new focus uh we should be able to get inventory down and and,those cells didn t materialize but now with this new focused we should be able to get inventory down and,
uh,obviously help improve the cashflow in the fourth quarter but uh we re excited about the new process and uh you,will obviously help improve the cash flow in the fourth quarter but we re excited and hopefully don t get,
uh,but uh we re excited about the new process and uh you know hopefully don t get back in the situation,but we re excited and hopefully don t get back in a situation where we build up inventory in anticipation,
uh,is this is an exciting move and one that s uh that we re excited uh anxious to get started got,participation sales that don t materialize this is an exciting move and one that we re anxious to get started,
uh,move and one that s uh that we re excited uh anxious to get started got it a and last quick,don t materialize this is an exciting move and one that we re anxious to get started and last quick,
uh,for you or look like are are we talking um uh additional shutdowns in china um as far as the risk,worsening conditions mean for you or look like are we talking additional shutdowns in china as far as the risk,
uh,boyd wants to jump in yeah it s it s uh forecasting in this environment and is extremely difficult um you,then if board wants to jump in and yeah it s forecasting in this environment and is extremely difficult you,
uh,you know as you know everybody reads what happens daily uh the news comes out and so right now we re,you know which it feels like you know now we re not even talking about that anymore but that was,
uh,out and so right now we re things are operating uh well in china uh things have re are recovering uh,you know we put a lot of language around the uncertainty things are operating well in china things are recovering,
uh,now we re things are operating uh well in china uh things have re are recovering uh so we ve got,a lot of language around the uncertainty things are operating well in china things are recovering so we ve got,
uh,uh well in china uh things have re are recovering uh so we ve got uh that that news there but,language around the uncertainty things are operating well in china things are recovering so we ve got that news there,
uh,things have re are recovering uh so we ve got uh that that news there but um you know things change,the uncertainty things are operating well in china things are recovering so we ve got that news there how we,
uh,things change daily so given where we are we expect uh a good quarter the fourth quarter but uh as as,this can and that s you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better quarter than we,
uh,we expect uh a good quarter the fourth quarter but uh as as i said things can change quickly and and,consistently which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the fourth quarter but we re excited and hopefully don,
uh,as as i said things can change quickly and and uh we ll just have to wait and see now we,a small way be good for cost and we ll just do that on an as needed basis and we,
uh,and be flexible in our in our flexible platforms but uh it s just a very very uncertain time right now,with covers already mattress covers that we re making through our gulf china platform have been very competitive competitive and,
uh,very uncertain time right now and so we re just uh being very cautious in how we forecast boyd i don,operating well in china things are recovering so we ve got that news there how we forecast boy i don,
uh,yeah i ll add to that ken thank you and uh marco just in relation to the current situation for the,yeah i ll add to that ken thank you marco just in relation to the current situation for the upholstery,
uh,normal situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there uh we had a uh one week delay in our uh,normal situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there we had a one week delay in our china operation,
uh,getting back to normal situations there uh we had a uh one week delay in our uh china operation um a,situations very quickly getting back to normal situations there we had a one week delay in our china operation a,
uh,uh we had a uh one week delay in our uh china operation um a government mandated one week delay before,normal situations there we had a one week delay in our china operation a government mandated one week delay before,
uh,ve seen some delays from our supply base but currently uh nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost,ve seen some delays from our supply base but currently nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost,
uh,again so the current situation is has been very positive uh we ve experienced minimal delays and disruptions to supply to,output again so the current situation has been very positive we ve experienced minimal delays and disruptions to supply to,
uh,situation for sure and and uncertainty the current picture is uh china has recovered quite nicely and our supply base is,to supply to our customer base as a result china has recovered quite nicely and our supply base is back,
uh,supply base is back to near full output and so uh at the moment there appears to be minimal disla dis,our supply base is back to near full output and so at the moment there appears to be minimal just,

uh,uh provide a little bit of color on how you uh you know kind of view the kind of the asset,good morning i was hoping you could provide a little bit of color of cash flows how does that test,
uh,a lot of assets there obviously there s at least uh a temporary impairment of cash flows um how does that,you look at the the mix on smaller patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the big iron how does that,
uh,jeff i i think if if we look at the uh th the service backlog right broadly just under 325 billion,we should be thinking about jeff i think if we look at the service backlog broadly just under 325 billion,

uh,for us what we should expect for for q2 and uh you know any high level thoughts on how the year,in this downturn what you would expect to to happen to work in capital when things recover and if there,
uh,the cash standpoint yeah jeff i i think that we uh we took guidance off the table a few weeks back,q2 which isn t surprising yes jeff i think that we took guidance off the table a few weeks back,

uh,a we re in a mode like this you re uh you re you re moving as quickly as you possibly,you well know that when we re in a mode like this you re moving as quickly as you possibly,
uh,those activities today the the the broadening across the company uh if you look at the the tally today there is,at aviation the doubling of those activities today the broadening across the company there is a decidedly short term bias,

uh,the the capex reduction that carolina referenced the 25 reduction uh year on year so a lot going on and uh,working capital and certainly the cap x reduction the carolina reference the 25 reduction year on year okay that s,
uh,uh year on year so a lot going on and uh by no means is this uh uh these headlines today,you this year on a cash basis i think we re probably going to end up more or less in,
uh,lot going on and uh by no means is this uh uh these headlines today the uh the end it s,past sure we ve seen anything kind of on par with this but there s no question that there s,
uh,going on and uh by no means is this uh uh these headlines today the uh the end it s very,going to play out as we go through the course of the year we can t really scope that for,
uh,no means is this uh uh these headlines today the uh the end it s very much a work in in,coming so there are a number of variables it s very much a work in progress as well but i,
uh,know debt that you can you can manage well we uh it it it it did come at a uh at,debt that you can manage relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here i think it s we,
uh,we uh it it it it did come at a uh at a at a good time uh there s there,ventilators and the like certainly got quite a boost but it s a small part of the business so there,
uh,come at a uh at a at a good time uh there s there s no question that s why we,come back to you larry carolina thank you there s no question that covid 19 is putting real pressure on,
uh,we put the emphasis in in the biopharma set up uh on on on certainty right we want to take the,using some of the lean tools working with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the,
uh,market risk off the table relative to thinking through the uh the healthcare options carolina anything uh you want to add,to work through this i think we feel very good about our ability got it carolina anything you would add,
uh,to thinking through the uh the healthcare options carolina anything uh you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity,thinking in terms of whittling down some of the debt that you can manage relative to kind of managing liquidity,
uh,of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important uh and we end the quarter with 47 billion cash right,it meant it s just important for us all to remember we ended the quarter but 47 billion of liquidity,
uh,and cannibalizations you know kind of make more of a uh a u shape versus you know what you know the,and aviation how the impact of retirements and cannibalizations kind of make more of a u shape versus what the,
uh,of the runtime on on otherwise idled assets well josh uh you know certainly we have uh we have revisited the,run time on otherwise idle assets well josh certainly we have revisited the history of the team as well versed,

uh,have uh we have revisited the history the team is uh is well versed in in what we have seen in,well josh certainly we have revisited the history of the team as well versed in what we have seen in,
uh,i m not sure we ve we ve seen anything uh kind of on par with uh with this um but,in what we have seen in years past sure we ve seen anything kind of on par with this but,
uh,we ve seen anything uh kind of on par with uh with this um but there s there s no question,seen in years past sure we ve seen anything kind of on par with this but there s no question,
uh,on the part of some as some of these fleet uh reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft,the push out by customers because of their own site restrictions and by us on the back of the travel,
uh,the older aircraft um and that will factor into the uh to the aftermarket much like some of the dynamics around,that reality and that applies really across the portfolio both on the oe side as well as the aftermarket spares,
uh,green time and how you re in the short term uh folks try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash,for us here in the short term i think what s most important for our business really is cycles much,
uh,try to preserve cash carriers try to preserve cash in uh in in their business so i m not sure that,ve seen us relevant to the plan design and some of the settlement options so i m not sure there,
uh,business so i m not sure that there is necessarily uh an exact model that captures what all the carriers in,no question that there s going to be a bias an exact model that captures what all the carriers and,
uh,all the carriers in aggregate are going to do here uh a model that offers great precision i think we do,all the carriers and aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision i think we do,
uh,for us um a force here in the short term uh i think what s most important for our business really,pressure for us for us here in the short term i think what s most important for our business really,
uh,business really is is cycles much more so than rev uh revenue passenger miles uh and as we see schedules come,important for our business really is cycles much more so than revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come,
uh,cycles much more so than rev uh revenue passenger miles uh and as we see schedules come back as we work,really is cycles much more so than revenue passenger miles and as we see schedules come back as we work,
uh,as we work our way through the pandemic that will uh that ll put us back on i think better footing,work our way through the pandemic that will put us back on i think better footing here in the short,

uh,re not putting it back on today just given the uh given the undue un uncertainty of it all right so,the year we re not putting it back on just given the given the undue uncertainty of it all right,
uh,uncertainty of it all right so i i don t uh i don t think we re trying to get out,undue uncertainty of it all right so i don t i don t think we re trying to get out,
uh,what what we re seeing but that said however long uh it takes us to work through this i think we,folks what we re seeing but that said however long it takes us to work through this i think we,
uh,ability to come out stronger and get back on a uh on a positive uh cashflow growth trajectory got got it,capacity to come out of the downturn well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you thank,
uh,stronger and get back on a uh on a positive uh cashflow growth trajectory got got it and carolina anything you,takes us to work through this i think we feel very good about our ability got it carolina anything you,
uh,got it and carolina anything you would add to that uh well no i think it s important to to acknowledge,our ability got it carolina anything you would add to that well no i think it s important to acknowledge,
uh,seeing already in april right it it really is hitting uh hitting us from a mix a mix perspective hard uh,seeing already in april it really is hitting us from a mixed perspective hard our highest margin of business is,
uh,uh hitting us from a mix a mix perspective hard uh our highest margin businesses are really feeling it here i,it really is hitting us from a mixed perspective hard our highest margin of business is really feeling it here,
uh,see it swing the other way when we get back uh and come off a bottom we should have positive mixed,see it swing the other way so when we get back and come off a bottom we should have a,
uh,come off a bottom we should have positive mixed effect uh really across the across the board particularly in aviation and,off a bottom we should have a positive mix of fact really across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare,
uh,to the cost actions and how much permanent how much uh not permanent yeah i i know i guess how much,to the cost actions and how much permanent how up with 2 3 billion of cost in cash you cut,
uh,couple hundred million in the first quarter um i mean uh most companies kind of one for one uh what how,significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter i mean most companies kind of won for one how,
uh,i mean uh most companies kind of one for one uh what how much is this stuff gonna cost you this,quarter i mean most companies kind of won for one how much is this stuff going to cost you this,
uh,were gonna be down off of last year from a uh from an expense and from a cash perspective i think,with all gets reset here and one of the real pressures we saw from a cash flow perspective was an,
uh,from a cash perspective i think we re we re uh probably gonna end up more or less in line right,on a cash basis i think we re probably going to end up more or less in line right in,
uh,furloughs don t carry a restructuring charge with that right uh because they aren t permanent so part of what we,actions like furloughs don t carry a restructuring charge with that because they aren t permanent so part of what,
uh,temporary costs um but all the while if we can uh we can make more structural moves we want to make,squeeze out some of the temporary costs but all the while if we can make more structural moves we want,
uh,that but i d say right now assume that it uh be relatively flat year on year but as carolina indicated,that but i d say right now assume that it would be relatively flat year on year but just we,
uh,and steve um let me maybe follow up on the uh on the aviation marcus good morning um hey good morning,good morning larry caroline and steve let me maybe follow up on the application marcus good morning hey good morning,
uh,are two different stories but is that sort of a uh a kind of scenario that you re playing through internally,and rpks are two different stories but it s not a kind of scenario that you re flying through internally,
uh,that we re gonna continue to see the pressure on uh on cash at aviation that we ve seen uh here,near that we re going to continue to see the pressure on cash and aviation that we ve seen here,
uh,on uh on cash at aviation that we ve seen uh here of late right and that that will be our,on cash and aviation that we ve seen here of late right and that will be undoubtedly our biggest headwind,
uh,undoubtedly our our biggest headwind no sure sure sure but uh you know the uh the you know sh shop visits,undoubtedly our biggest headwind no sure but you know internal stress test around where you could end up or if,
uh,headwind no sure sure sure but uh you know the uh the you know sh shop visits we heard sort of,headwind no sure but you know internal stress test around where you could end up or if that is just,
uh,s plenty there s plenty of of of planning for uh again a uh an extended uh slowdown here we re,too early to comment no no no there s plenty of planning for again an extended slowdown here we re,

uh,thinking about that at the moment on the current support uh to capital um yeah on the insurance yeah let s,number are you thinking about that at the moment on the parent support to capital and on the insurance let,
uh,s yeah let s take a step back then so uh in 19 the capital had an infusion from uh ge,on the insurance let s take a step back then so in 19 the capital had an infusion from ge,
uh,so uh in 19 the capital had an infusion from uh ge of four billion right and the estimate for for,so in 19 the capital had an infusion from ge of four billion right and the estimate for this year,
uh,and the estimate for for this year is two billion uh on the insurance funding um and those two billion um,and the estimate for this year is two billion on insurance funding need to support rough in mind with this,
uh,um you know they re significantly lower than the year uh before um we estimated that the inaudible will need to,any other indicator and those cycles are before the passengers do as you indicated the age of the fleet will,
uh,um and i would also say going forward inaudible followup uh we do continue to to anticipate further funding um and,would also to say going forward which is a political follow up we do continue to anticipate further funding and,
uh,yeah thank you good morning guys good morning two question uh two questions so morning at at aviation it sounds like,quartan khanna yeah thank you good morning guys good morning so at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that,
uh,because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know uh a surge of used serviceable material and the like part,because of a younger fleet emerging you know a surge of use serviceable material and the like hardouts obviously lower,
uh,first question is when do you anticipate aviation free cashflow uh getting to break even is it even possible before calendar,the first question is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even even possible before calendar,
uh,to break even is it even possible before calendar 22 uh in that in ty type of environment and then i,free cash flow getting to break even even possible before calendar 22 in that type of environment and then i,
uh,indicator and those cycles are gonna have to come back uh before the passengers do uh a as you indicated the,business much more so than any other indicator and those cycles are before the passengers do as you indicated the,
uh,gonna have to come back uh before the passengers do uh a as you indicated the age of the fleet will,any other indicator and those cycles are before the passengers do as you indicated the age of the fleet will,

uh,you re alluding to i i think right now the uh the simple reality at aviation given the pressures and the,you re alluding to much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i,

uh,uh good morning dean good good morning just two questions uh both aviation um lot of discussion about structural cost out,you good morning dean good morning ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that s the,
uh,larry would be interested in how have you balanced the uh the structural cost out in aviation with rifts and and,us on how you see the working capital cash impact at geaviation sort of in the early stages now in,
uh,how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back uh when it does ramp back up so that s the,good morning ability to bounce back when it does ramp back up so that s the first question and then,
uh,just to make sure i heard it correctly were there uh did you quantify the lead cancellations in the quarter i,make sure i heard it correctly did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter i know there s delivery,
uh,cancellations that s it for me thank you d dean uh uh maybe i ll take the first part of that,in terms of engine cancellations that s it for me and maybe i ll take the first part of that,

uh,on the retirement i m jealous by the way laugh uh uh um so to start off so can you tell,i ll congratulate you on the retirement i m jealous by the way so to start off can you tell,
uh,the retirement i m jealous by the way laugh uh uh um so to start off so can you tell us,ll congratulate you on the retirement i m jealous by the way so to start off can you tell us,
uh,the the the guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek uh happy to um walk you through that a bit so,going to be used into the guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek i m happy to walk you through,
uh,tailwind that probably represents you know 500 basis points of uh of of of improvement or growth that s associated predominantly,that i d start is probably about 40 decrementals it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix,
uh,um but every test that we produce every single day uh gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build um,our capacity but every test that we produce every single day gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build,
uh,positive growth that s not exclusively covid related but certainly uh related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines so,side related but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccines so i think that s the way,
uh,i d i d sort of generally frame up the uh the pluses and the minuses around the covid impact in,the way i d sort of generally frame up the the pluses and the minuses around the covid impact in,
uh,just wanna make sure also um you ve kind of uh we mentioned serology we are not assuming anything here in,it s matt hey derek it s matt kind of we mentioned serology we are not assuming anything here in,
uh,tell you know what the volumes might look like what uh a national testing program or any other kind of local,tell what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs,
uh,standalone business for the second quarter um derek we saw uh you know very little it s always hard to tell,reasonable place for the business to be here in the second quarter as well so i think your math on,

uh,some cleanup relative to the things that are attached there uh relative to your your second part of the question in,some cleanup relative to the things that are attached there relative to your second part of the question in terms,
uh,the stipulation i think we ve just been working collectively uh and and again we we felt this way all along,the stipulation i think we ve just been working collectively and again we ve just been working collectively that the,
uh,along that that the pipe that we ve been replacing uh meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be,that the pipe that we ve been replacing meets all the requirements relative to what needs even to the fact,
uh,part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the isrs program uh even to the fact that we still agree that that,all the requirements relative to what needs even to the fact that we still agree that the plastics that we,
uh,replacing are much more efficient way to upgrade our system uh but this primarily focused on the bare steel and cast,replacing are a much more efficient way to upgrade our system but this primarily focused on the bare stealing cast,
uh,those criteria we re providing additional evidence but i think uh in terms of the reason that we got to this,those criteria we re providing additional evidence but i think in terms of the reason that we ve got to,
uh,and again even with the cases that are still there uh we ll continue to present evidence uh and hopefully make,and served this side of the state very well as we went through winter we ll continue to operate that,
uh,are still there uh we ll continue to present evidence uh and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had,that we ll continue to bring you along for the journey so as we think about the amount that we,
uh,around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years uh is the same criteria that we re using going forward,system that had been replaced in previous years is the same criteria that we re using going forward got it,
uh,couple of things first of all i guess the downside uh the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it,things first of all i guess the downside of the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does,
uh,that has impacted our margins is it does give us uh a little bit better uh working conditions on our capital,weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital,
uh,is it does give us uh a little bit better uh working conditions on our capital spend and as as steve,our margins is it does give us a little bit better working conditions on our capital spend and as steve,
uh,and as as steve talked about we had a strong uh winter season and now we re heading into the the,and as steve talked about we had a strong winter season and now we re by upgrading our infrastructure but,
uh,s point number one and then number two you know uh playbook for utilities as we look at how we can,end this year well you know we re kind of writing the playbook as we go right now there s,
uh,at how we can best um try to offset both uh the headwinds from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus,in the back half of 2020 to offset some of this headwind there are two other key variants in this,
uh,s clearly something that helps get us back to work uh and we re doing it with the cooperation and understanding,they re able to learn from home since we re all in this together we ve been coordinating and staying,
uh,again while this past quarter was only really several weeks uh in terms of the measurement period uh we never stopped,as we and again while this past quarter was only really several weeks in terms of the measurement period we,
uh,really several weeks uh in terms of the measurement period uh we never stopped working uh and and you ll hear,really several weeks in terms of the measurement period we think about it from a construction and capital perspective we,
uh,terms of the measurement period uh we never stopped working uh and and you ll hear some businesses talk about return,terms of the measurement period we think about it from a construction and capital perspective we really didn t we,
uh,you ll hear some businesses talk about return to work uh we talked about more of the transition and if you,to drive the kind of growth that we talked about in the long term over the bottom line i chuckle,
uh,you think about it from a construction and capital perspective uh we we really didn t take our foot off the,think about it from a construction and capital perspective we really didn t we obviously changed some of our processes,
uh,honest we limited going into customer s homes to do uh service uh tie overs and change overs we ll go,to be quite honest we ve limited going into customers homes to do service towers and changeovers we ll go,
uh,limited going into customer s homes to do uh service uh tie overs and change overs we ll go back and,quite honest we ve limited going into customers homes to do service towers and changeovers we ll go back and,
uh,the other part i would just wanna reinforce is that uh our capital for these type programs is fairly evenly distributed,other part i would just want to reinforce is that our capital for these type programs is fairly evenly distributed,

uh,wondering if you guys have a better sense at all uh how whether legislation would preclude uh the need for a,that they can settle so that s not unusual at all in the legislative process right let me just ask,
uh,better sense at all uh how whether legislation would preclude uh the need for a ruling at the supreme court or,from michael weinstein with credit suisse please go ahead hi good morning a ruling at the supreme court or not,
uh,longer term fix we obviously are continuing to work with uh missouri public service commission the staff the opc and the,longer term fix we obviously are continuing to work with the missouri public service commission and the staff the opc,
uh,crispin inaudible up the um the support for our filings uh but then also to get to a more unified view,to not only crisp it up the support for filings but then also to get to a more unified view,
uh,judicial outcome and so all three of those paths so uh we re on track with what we strategically set out,s all consistent with where we started this journey so we re on track with what we strategically set out,
uh,track with what we strategically set out to begin with uh what s the july 16th decision that we re waiting,track with what we strategically set out to begin with what s the july 16th decision that we re waiting,
uh,that we re waiting on what is that okay so uh so this would be a d this is on the,that we re waiting on what is that in essence have 120 days to make a decision based on those,
uh,so once they go back to the public service commission uh they in essence have 120 days to make a decision,that we re waiting on what is that in essence have 120 days to make a decision based on those,
uh,by the regulators right on the inaudible right crosstalk yeah uh this is it s been remanded back to the missouri,regulatory but that is on the cases that were under appeal that have been remanded back to the commission or,

uh,morning this is steve lindsey thanks for the question and uh i wish i knew all the answers to that because,i m steve lindsey thanks for the question i wish i knew all the answers to that because it s,
uh,answers to that because it s a very complex formula uh i think the one thing i would say is is,answers to that because it s a very complex formula behave a lot like the residential class so i think,
uh,now that we didn t have before which is positive uh it did help but it didn t completely address the,moving parts that are going on here from the legislative perspective and regulatory but that is on the cases that,
uh,it didn t completely address the the the differences between uh weather obviously and and and the volumes and the revenue,so you just go over the difference between the two virgins of the house and senate bill and where you,
uh,it one is and i think that steve mentioned this uh first of all it does not even include uh the,covid related pressures richie this is steve great question couple things first of all i guess the downside of the,
uh,this uh first of all it does not even include uh the small commercial class and some of those others that,richie this is steve great question couple things first of all i guess the downside of the warmer weather that,
uh,and and again it s a it s a start uh it s not perfect we recognize that and we think,as we move forward and again it s a start it s not perfect we recognize that and we think,
uh,we recognize that and we think we ll be able uh to make a pretty strong presentation as to where the,we recognize that and we think as to where the deficiencies are because again the program is intended to mitigate,
uh,are because again the program is intended to mitigate risk uh as as steve indicated uh if it s too cold,as to where the deficiencies are because again the program is intended to mitigate risk if it s too cold,

uh,we continue to collect on those and we re collecting uh two million and change every quarter um so up until,we continue to collect on those every quarter so up until the time that the missouri public service commission and,
uh,16 9 million part of it has to do with uh uh the um conclusion whether um inaudible bare steel was,16 9 million part of it has to do steel and the public service commission is going to have to,
uh,9 million part of it has to do with uh uh the um conclusion whether um inaudible bare steel was worn,16 9 million part of it has to do steel and the public service commission is going to have to,
uh,and another component about um incidental plastics that are replaced uh along with longer lines of the uh the cast iron,a pace that at least we re pleased so far okay got it thank you very much the next question,
uh,that are replaced uh along with longer lines of the uh the cast iron of bare steel and the public service,there are various components of that 16 9 million part of it has to do steel and the public service,
uh,of those individual isrs determinations but it will also have uh determined whether or not um determined whether or not the,of those individual isras determinations whether or not the amounts will be refunded to the extent they determine fund or,
uh,public service commission then i think we re we re uh obviously obligated to take a look at our net economic,from the public service commission that i think we were obviously obligated to take a look at our net economic,
uh,that those revenues are now not going to be earned uh revenues or earnings and then we would adjust our economics,it s a busy earnings day we re going to be around throughout the rest of the day and we,
uh,the last fiscal year okay got it understood and then uh just on the the equity uh if if i heard,we booked for the last fiscal year okay got it understood and then just on the equity if i heard,
uh,it understood and then uh just on the the equity uh if if i heard you correctly you issued 10 million,year okay got it understood and then just on the equity if i heard you correctly you issued 10 million,
uh,range of um of equity of 50 to 100 million uh is our total need for the year so in the,guided range of equity of 50 to 100 million dollars is our total need for the year so in the,
uh,year so in the first quarter we knocked out roughly uh 10 million of that at the low end um and,year so in the first quarter we knocked out roughly 10 million of that at the low end rating agencies,
uh,discussions with our rating agencies we we do have some uh leverage and some um cushion in our our credit metrics,of that at the low end rating agencies we do have some leverage and some cushion in our credit metrics,
uh,s always looking at so um we do believe that uh we will be in the equity markets later this year,everybody is always looking at so we do believe that we will be in the equity markets later this year,
uh,in our longterm guidance okay and then the the february uh stipulation uh on 11 1 million revenues uh under isrs,ve guided in our long term guidance okay and then the february stipulation on 11 1 million revenues under isrs,
uh,longterm guidance okay and then the the february uh stipulation uh on 11 1 million revenues uh under isrs is that,our long term guidance okay and then the february stipulation on 11 1 million revenues under isrs is that what,
uh,the february uh stipulation uh on 11 1 million revenues uh under isrs is that what you filed for boy uh,the february stipulation on 11 1 million revenues under isrs is that what you filed for boy we filed for,
uh,uh under isrs is that what you filed for boy uh we filed for um the the reason why i m,1 million revenues under isrs is that what you filed for boy we filed for the reason why i m,
uh,filed for um the the reason why i m struggling uh brian is that we filed for a lot of different,filed for the reason why i m struggling brian is that we filed for a lot of different numbers not,
uh,for a lot of different numbers because we filed for uh amounts that had not been awarded for plastics and prior,struggling brian is that we filed for a lot of different numbers not been awarded for plastics and prior filings,
uh,to get out of the filing it was probably in uh i don t have it off the top of my,to get out of the filing it was probably and i don t have it off the top of my,
uh,case and and that is clearly what happened in this uh in this filing for isrs i m sorry okay and,so that always gets chewed up in a rape case and that is clearly what happened in this violence and,
uh,kind of writing the playbook as we go right now uh there s probably at least uh another couple of weeks,kind of writing the playbook as we go right now there s probably at least another couple weeks of session,
uh,we go right now uh there s probably at least uh another couple of weeks of session uh i know that,the playbook as we go right now there s probably at least another couple weeks of session i know that,
uh,probably at least uh another couple of weeks of session uh i know that again this is this is not a,probably at least another couple weeks of session i know that again and this was just to start up again,
uh,this was just to start up again and we were uh we were very pleased to be included as part of,this was just to start up again and we were very pleased to be included as part of the legislation,
uh,included as part of the legislation as being considered but uh we we came out or or as we talked about,included as part of the legislation as being considered but we came out or as we talked about of both,
uh,would say that it doesn t directly because it is uh uh looking forward but i think it what it does,would say that it doesn t directly because it is a looking forward but i think what it does is,
uh,say that it doesn t directly because it is uh uh looking forward but i think it what it does is,would say that it doesn t directly because it is a looking forward but i think what it does is,
uh,i think it what it does is is give some uh hopefully guidance to the commission that that what we ve,looking forward but i think what it does is give some hopefully guidance to the commission that what we ve,
uh,the assumption though for over 15 years has been validated uh and has been cleaned up if you will and this,assumptions of for over 15 years has been validated and has been cleaned up if you will in this legislation,
uh,up if you will and this legislation again we think uh that everything we ve been doing from this point forward,up if you will in this legislation again we think that everything requirements and i m sure everyone on the,
uh,this point forward from when the program went into place uh has been has met those requirements i think this reinforces,to the other chamber and the the other chamber as other elements which is what happened in this instance so,
uh,that s not uncommon okay um i think you referenced uh additional uh investment in store or in storage for 10,that s not uncommon okay i think you referenced additional investment in store or in store for 10 million how,
uh,not uncommon okay um i think you referenced uh additional uh investment in store or in storage for 10 million how,not uncommon okay i think you referenced additional investment in store or in store for 10 million how much more,
uh,with the longer range plan but what our commitment to uh to our investors and to you all is that we,the longer range plan but what our commitment to our investors and to you all is that we ll continue,
uh,or could it be improved before then that would be uh yes so so your um your your questions basically how,order to be improved or could it be improved before then that would be yeah so your question basically i,
uh,answer it it is a part of the overall rate uh rate structure and so that will be part of our,answered it so it is part of the overall rate structure and so that would be part of our next,
uh,say again that s not unusual the key requirements of uh a rate case is to set revenue requirement and rate,would say again that s not unusual the two requirements of the rate case or set revenue requirement and rate,

uh,re discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses uh given it s their more project versus the industrial compressor,up shifting exposure in itnes run rate of these businesses given it s their more project versus the industrial compressor,
uh,it s their more project versus the industrial compressor business uh yeah andy let me just give you a little bit,it s their more project versus the industrial compressor business yeah honey let me just give you a little bit,
uh,total orders down 20 book to bill greater than one uh from a book to bill perspective you know the uh,total order is down 20 book to bill greater than one from a book to bill perspective you know the,
uh,uh from a book to bill perspective you know the uh industrial technology and the uh position on science where we,than one from a book to bill perspective you know the industrial technology you know i will categorize it as,
uh,bill perspective you know the uh industrial technology and the uh position on science where we re greater uh than one,bill perspective you know the industrial technology you know i will categorize it as you know the short cycle was,
uh,and the uh position on science where we re greater uh than one and obviously leading the way uh i ll,long cycle yeah i know yeah great question and then obviously when you look at it within the month i,
uh,re greater uh than one and obviously leading the way uh i ll say you know in terms of in terms,order to get the incremental down to the 15 and i ll say you know from a long term perspective,
uh,you know i will categorize it as you know the uh the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter,technology you know i will categorize it as you know the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter,
uh,mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see uh you know some relatively weakness uh here uh moving forward,cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see you know some relative weakness here moving forward,
uh,and continue to see uh you know some relatively weakness uh here uh moving forward i mean it s it s,and continue to see you know some relative weakness here moving forward i mean it s mostly correlated to i,
uh,to see uh you know some relatively weakness uh here uh moving forward i mean it s it s it s,to see you know some relative weakness here moving forward i mean it s mostly correlated to i guess maybe,
uh,mean it s it s it s mostly correlated to uh i guess maybe the pmi uh you know from uh,mean it s mostly correlated to i guess maybe the pmi you know from the down and the mainstream which,
uh,s mostly correlated to uh i guess maybe the pmi uh you know from uh from the down in the mainstream,s mostly correlated to i guess maybe the pmi you know from the down and the mainstream which is what,
uh,uh i guess maybe the pmi uh you know from uh from the down in the mainstream which is what we,mostly correlated to i guess maybe the pmi you know from the down and the mainstream which is what we,
uh,what we consider to be more on the loan cycle uh i ll say you know comparatively a bit more stable,is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle the first half of the year in order to,
uh,i ll say you know comparatively a bit more stable uh in the first quarter and uh and and we kind,million of in year you know and i ll say that it s kind of consistent third quarter and fourth,
uh,a bit more stable uh in the first quarter and uh and and we kind of continue to see maybe some,as you know the short cycle was mostly most impacted in the quarter and continue to see you know some,
uh,see maybe some of that in the month of april uh again typically we tend to get the orders for that,out you know on the other side of this downturn i think we typically see kind of the base what,
uh,first half of the year in order to get shipments uh in the second half um and uh and and and,on the loan cycle the first half of the year in order to get shipments in the second half and,
uh,to get shipments uh in the second half um and uh and and and from a ppl p from a power,half of the year in order to get shipments in the second half and from a ptl from a power,
uh,a power tool perspective yeah i mean rough rough quartering uh in the in the in in q1 uh as as,a power to perspective yeah i mean rough quarter in q1 as i alluded i mean last year they were,
uh,rough quartering uh in the in the in in q1 uh as as i alluded i mean last year they we,rough quarter in q1 as i alluded i mean last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from,
uh,they we re seeing some fairly good growth momentum from uh their expansion into online uh retailers and uh and you,alluded i mean last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion retailers and and you,
uh,fairly good growth momentum from uh their expansion into online uh retailers and uh and you saw that uh in the,year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion retailers and and you saw that in the,
uh,momentum from uh their expansion into online uh retailers and uh and you saw that uh in the first quarter many,seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion retailers and and you saw that in the first quarter many,
uh,into online uh retailers and uh and you saw that uh in the first quarter many of these only reta retailers,growth momentum from their expansion retailers and and you saw that in the first quarter many of these only retailers,
uh,first quarter many of these only reta retailers they moved uh to having other kind of more household goods or or,first quarter many of these only retailers they moved to having other kind of more household goods or critical needs,
uh,kind of more household goods or or or critical needs uh to fight covid uh covid 19 and clearly you know,moved to having other kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight covid 19 and clearly you know,
uh,goods or or or critical needs uh to fight covid uh covid 19 and clearly you know these business uh saw,other kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight covid 19 and clearly you know this business saw,
uh,covid uh covid 19 and clearly you know these business uh saw some of the impact i d say april sale,critical needs to fight covid 19 and clearly you know this business saw some of the impact so that s,
uh,some of the impact i d say april sale is uh relatively slow so we haven t seen the uh the,some of the compared first couple of data points that we look at at the same time you know just,
uh,is uh relatively slow so we haven t seen the uh the uh the people that with the momentum of uh,know since we we didn t own the legacy ir for the we just tend to not comment on what,
uh,relatively slow so we haven t seen the uh the uh the people that with the momentum of uh of the,then obviously when you look at it within the month i mean at the month of april you know there,
uh,uh the uh the people that with the momentum of uh of the power tool business so that that s helpful,sure yes i mean for sure the power tool and the listing business was one that it was worse than,
uh,s that s kinda what we re targeting for and uh uh i mean uh as you have seen you know,that would be helpful yeah so for sure you know that s what we re targeting to be you know,
uh,that s kinda what we re targeting for and uh uh i mean uh as you have seen you know we,would be helpful yeah so for sure you know that s what we re targeting to be you know the,
uh,what we re targeting for and uh uh i mean uh as you have seen you know we have performed well,what we re targeting to be you know the breakeven and even positive i mean we re taking some pretty,
uh,have performed well in the down cycles in the past uh i think we have a good solid playbook that we,of products either now or later in the future so i think we re really executing a good playbook here,
uh,included both not only the in industrial downturn but also uh an upstream downturn uh you know base decrementals they tend,can be explained by the jobs of the industrial of the i also what happens of service during the what,
uh,the in industrial downturn but also uh an upstream downturn uh you know base decrementals they tend to be around 40,the industrial of the i also what happens of service during the what happened to us yeah what happened to,
uh,around 40 across the business with a slightly higher in uh in businesses like uh uh the high pressure as you,have temporary costs probably coming back to the business with typical incremental margins i m not sure how best you,
uh,business with a slightly higher in uh in businesses like uh uh the high pressure as you mentioned as well as,by day i mean clearly on the high pressure solution which is as you mentioned the most exposed i mean,
uh,with a slightly higher in uh in businesses like uh uh the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the,we live by day by day i mean clearly on the high pressure solution which is as you mentioned the,
uh,the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the uh precision and signs because of the nice uh high gross,about decrementals with high pressure solutions the order is down 80 can you hold decrementals there in the mid 40s,
uh,as the uh precision and signs because of the nice uh high gross margins that both businesses have and you know,the change in customer behavior from that power tooled business now have you know smaller up shifting exposure in itnes,
uh,have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles and uh the indulgent technologies they tend to play in that kind,overall in the rest of the business yeah the industrial technologies they tend to play in that kind of 40,
uh,to play in that kind of 40 pers 40 range uh you know your seeing that we have taken very decisive,to play in that kind of 40 percent range you know you ve seen that we have taken very decisive,
uh,very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions uh to protect the margin uh we saw as we ve,very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin we saw as you mentioned some,
uh,and the short term actions uh to protect the margin uh we saw as we ve mentioned you know some very,decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions to protect the margin we saw as you mentioned some very,
uh,decrementals with the target being closer closer to that 30 uh of uh of uh of of of of the inaudible,decrimentals with a 20 decline that you re seeing overall in the rest of the business yeah the industrial technologies,
uh,the target being closer closer to that 30 uh of uh of uh of of of of the inaudible and you,think it s prudent because we re clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution you see,
uh,being closer closer to that 30 uh of uh of uh of of of of the inaudible and you know when,bit more color here particularly you know ways of comparing some of the you know the industrial technology is composed,
uh,clearly taking much more aggressive actions in the high pressure uh around course actions based on what we see here with,i mean we re taking some pretty aggressive actions 100 after market and consumable so that kind of carries a,
uh,see here with a lot of our data points and uh and the long duration of the downturn that we expect,see incrementals coming out you know on the other side of this downturn i think we typically see kind of,
uh,you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the uh cost synergies through the year and also of that um,you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the that are more related to discretionary,
uh,things he maybe break it down into the two buckets uh as as you suggest to me on the 40 to,don t tend to put a a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the shelf so to,
uh,me on the 40 to 50 that we spoke about uh that are kind of more related to uh discretionary or,could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the that are more related to discretionary or,
uh,spoke about uh that are kind of more related to uh discretionary or kind of volume related those are largely second,phasing of the cost synergies through the that are more related to discretionary or volume related those are largely second,
uh,related those are largely second quarter and the third quarter uh with a good majority i would say more more so,volume related those are largely second quarter during the third quarter with a good majority i would say more so,
uh,good majority i would say more more so on the uh on the second quarter uh from my from the cost,good majority i would say more so on the second quarter synergy perspective 2 million out of the 80 to,
uh,more more so on the uh on the second quarter uh from my from the cost synergy perspective million dollars uh,third quarter with a good majority i would say more so on the second quarter synergy perspective 2 million out,
uh,uh from my from the cost synergy perspective million dollars uh you know inaudible probably 80 to 90 million of end,on the second quarter synergy perspective 2 million out of the 80 to 90 million of in year you know,
uh,that kind of q3 and q4 then maybe just my uh second question um for you or for emily around the,dollars that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of q3 and q4 emily around the,
uh,free cash flow is that a good performance in q1 uh just wondered you know you the assumptions around a a,free cash flow she had a good performance in q1 just wondered you know you have assumptions around a break,
uh,for the year what type of free cash flow conversion uh should we expect you know how do you see working,are down call it 20 25 for the year what type of free cash flow conversion should we expect the,
uh,heard i think in the free cash that 63 million uh of transaction and separation cash cost in q1 what s,conversion should we expect the free cash that 63 million of transaction and separation cash cost in q1 what s,
uh,and separation cash cost in q1 what s the rough uh assumptions for the year um yes we re very pleased,and separation cash cost in q1 what s the rough assumption for the year julian and we ve been managing,
uh,to put in good processes and strong controls around it uh given the current crisis we we we expect cash to,know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it given the current crisis we expect cash to,
uh,any very rough g i d post for the year uh in light of about 63 million in q1 there ll,how about the costs i d posed for the year in light of that 63 million in qe1 there will,
uh,a as you recall you know we always said that uh that we were going for uh you know as we,synergy opportunities you re seeing as you recall you know we always said that we were going for you know,
uh,we always said that uh that we were going for uh you know as we with 60 days pays into uh,we always said that we were going for you know into the transaction we have all these air visibility as,
uh,uh you know as we with 60 days pays into uh into into into the transaction we have all these serviceability,know we always said that we were going for you know into the transaction we have all these air visibility,
uh,have all these serviceability as to what that funnel could uh could could potentially be roughly the a 100 million comes,these air visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be roughly 100 million comes from a combination of structural,
uh,a 100 million comes from a combination of structural savings uh a rationalization kind of non manufacturing alluded to on the,comes from a combination of structural savings savings as well as rationalization kind of non manufacturing alluded to on the,
uh,we have now a pretty good database o all the uh uh the locations across the world and that is given,the investors we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving,
uh,have now a pretty good database o all the uh uh the locations across the world and that is given us,investors we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving us,
uh,very good way for us to really understand and rationalize uh not so much the m are coming year two year,very good way for us to really understand and rationalize not so much the coming year two year three but,
uh,are coming year two year three but more more the uh the older kind of perspective so so um the second,and rationalize not so much the coming year two year three but more the other kind of perspective so second,
uh,and and some of the extra things emily just referenced uh what would it take for you guys to be a,and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn t be possible without the dedication,
uh,you inaudible to do that that we re going into uh some sort of recession here who knows how long inaudible,related to that that we re going into some sort of recession here who knows how long next couple of,
uh,plus months yeah no absolutely mike i mean i think uh y y you know clearly over the next uh couple,next six nine plus months yeah no absolutely mike i mean i think you know clearly over the next couple,
uh,think uh y y you know clearly over the next uh couple of years uh continue to be a a really,absolutely mike i mean i think you know clearly over the next couple of years continue to be a really,
uh,you know clearly over the next uh couple of years uh continue to be a a really part of our strategy,i think you know clearly over the next couple of years continue to be a really part of our strategy,
uh,continue to be a a really part of our strategy uh you know we see it s a very unique environment,years continue to be a really part of our strategy you know we see it s a very unique environment,
uh,we see it s a very unique environment right now uh we still see at this point in time some very,we see it s a very unique environment right now we still see at this point in time some very,
uh,on also very good funnel around you know ingersoll technologies uh but they re really more related towards inaudible thank you,on also very good funnel around you know industrial but there are really more related problems thank you your next,
uh,what happened to s our service yeah yeah i think uh uh uh tell me china was definitely impacted largely in,what happened to us i would say this yeah yeah i think i mean china was definitely impacted largely in,

uh,points that we look at so the third party report uh uh at the same time you know to just to,of the compared first couple of data points that we look at at the same time you know just to,
uh,that we look at so the third party report uh uh at the same time you know to just to give,the compared first couple of data points that we look at at the same time you know just to give,
uh,were down in the low single in the market and uh you know since since we since we didn t own,were down in the low single store in the market and you know since we we didn t own the,
uh,didn t own the legacy ir for the full quarter uh we just tend to not comment on what we saw,didn t own the legacy ir for the we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically you,
uh,to to be k kind of like inaudible for longer uh yeah would you expect revenues to kind of like just,8 this business to be kind of like weaker for longer would you expect revenues to kind of like just,
uh,be you know the bre breakeven and even even positive uh i mean we re taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions,know the breakeven and even positive i mean we re taking some pretty aggressive actions 100 after market and consumable,
uh,consumable so that that kind of carries a much better uh margin profile too as well and you know those factories,so that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well and you know those factories that are,
uh,and you know those factories that are kind of not uh not not uh needed based on volume i mean we,and you know those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume low exposure so a good playbook,
uh,those factories that are kind of not uh not not uh needed based on volume i mean we re basically keeping,profile too as well and you know those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume low exposure,
uh,based on volume i mean we re basically keeping them uh close or or very very low uh exposure so he,mentioned the most exposed i mean customers are still paying they take longer to pay but they still pay they,
uh,basically keeping them uh close or or very very low uh exposure so he had a good playbook on how how,those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume low exposure so a good playbook on how to,
uh,how how to navi have done extensive work a and uh you know i think we we see that we can,playbook on how to navigate has done extensive work and you know i think we we see that we can,
uh,is that it s gonna be down for a while uh and and to the same question you know i mean,is that it s going to be down for a while and to the second question you know i mean,
uh,we just come back to service for a moment vincente uh interesting comment about the utilization down from uh 30 but,we could just come back to service for a moment this is an interesting comment about the utilization down from,
uh,moment vincente uh interesting comment about the utilization down from uh 30 but how do we actually interpret and a a,an interesting comment about the utilization down from 30 but how do we actually interpret and apply that to a,
uh,i don t know if you have enough data historically uh to kind of piece that together but what does that,don t believe data historically to kind of piece that together but what does that down 30 tell you yeah,
uh,but what does that down 30 tell you yeah jeff uh great question i hinted uh so in terms of the,piece that together but what does that down 30 tell you yeah jeff great question so in terms of the,

uh,know in terms of in terms of being down 30 uh i mean i think we just see that as as,know on the other side of this downturn i think we typically see kind of the base what i call,
uh,bit of indication as to what could happen here here uh but uh as you he was a great correct correlation,still more resilient from that perspective as to what could happen here but as you gave us a great correlation,

uh,keep focusing them on those areas regions and markets that uh that we re still seeing some very good utilization of,focusing them on those areas regions and markets that we re still seeing some obviously includes more than compressors back,
uh,obviously includes more than compressors that are you suggesting that uh those other sort of products ar areas outside of vacuums,still seeing some obviously includes more than compressors back are you suggesting that those other products areas outside of vacuums,
uh,yes so for sure yes i mean for sure the uh the power tool and the lifting business uh uh was,blowers were substantial yes so for sure yes i mean for sure the power tool and the listing business was,
uh,sure the uh the power tool and the lifting business uh uh was one that it was worse uh than that,sure the power tool and the listing business was one that it was worse than that i mean the power,
uh,the uh the power tool and the lifting business uh uh was one that it was worse uh than that uh,yes i mean for sure the power tool and the listing business was one that it was worse than that,
uh,lifting business uh uh was one that it was worse uh than that uh i mean the power tools as cats,tool and the listing business was one that it was worse than that i mean the power tools is cats,
uh,uh was one that it was worse uh than that uh i mean the power tools as cats uh they have,the listing business was one that it was worse than that i mean the power tools is cats they have,
uh,than that uh i mean the power tools as cats uh they have uh two main product lines i mean it,that i mean the power tools is cats they have two main so i think you know that was impacted,
uh,i mean the power tools as cats uh they have uh two main product lines i mean it s that tool,i mean the power tools is cats they have two main so i think you know that was impacted more,
uh,mean it s that tool business but also they have uh a a lifting business uh that is kind of more,i mean the power tools is cats they have two main so i think you know that was impacted more,
uh,business but also they have uh a a lifting business uh that is kind of more related to to factory consumption,is cats they have two main so i think you know that was impacted more so and then china as,
uh,kind of more related to to factory consumption or factory uh rationalization so i think you know that that was impacted,that i mean the power tools is cats they have two main so i think you know that was impacted,
uh,rationalization so i think you know that that was impacted uh more so uh and then china as a region was,have two main so i think you know that was impacted more so and then china as a region was,
uh,think you know that that was impacted uh more so uh and then china as a region was definitely uh uh,think you know that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely like nash garo liquor,
uh,so uh and then china as a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh,so and then china as a region was definitely like nash garo liquor green ponds and liquor green vacuums those,
uh,uh and then china as a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh from,think you know that was impacted more so and then china as a region was definitely like nash garo liquor,
uh,china as a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh from the other product,china as a region was definitely like nash garo liquor green ponds and liquor green vacuums those are more longer,
uh,a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh from the other product lines in,mean china was definitely impacted largely in january and february the legacy ir business they have a pretty sizable china,
uh,uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh from the other product lines in terms of the longer,pmi you know from the down and the mainstream which is what we consider to be more on the loan,
uh,the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle uh which these are kind of brands like a uh nash,so in terms of the historical data we don t have a lot of historical because as you know as,
uh,cycle uh which these are kind of brands like a uh nash gil inaudible and liko green vacuums those are more,then china as a region was definitely like nash garo liquor green ponds and liquor green vacuums those are more,
uh,rosseau from evercore isi your line is open good morning uh my question s about in the its the inventory and,from evercore isi your line is open good morning my question is about in the itf s inventory in the,
uh,if if say the pmi has got better for example uh yeah there i mean i think you know when when,experience if say the pmi s got better for example yeah dave i mean i think you know when we,
uh,look when we look at the inventory in those channels uh i mean there s just no these from a from,you know when we look at the inventory in those channels i mean there s just no ideas from a,
uh,a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has uh the biggest size of the distribution that work and and,a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network products you know,
uh,also a more particularly towards the gardner denver branded products uh you know we don t tend to have a lot,has the biggest size of the distribution network products you know we don t tend to have a lot of,
uh,because these these are particularly smaller distributors more so unk uh more than localized they don t tend to to put,lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors more sub regionalized more localized they don t tend to put,
uh,i mean maybe on the smaller compressors they they may uh but not on the medium to high level compressors and,more localized they don t tend to put a a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the,
uh,in more on consumables aftermarket i m really move fairly uh fa fairly well i mean they turn pretty quickly vicente,market and consumable so that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well and you know those,
uh,i would categorize it as a set of civilization and uh uh initially and then obviously when you look within the,long cycle yeah i know yeah great question and then obviously when you look at it within the month i,
uh,would categorize it as a set of civilization and uh uh initially and then obviously when you look within the month,long cycle yeah i know yeah great question and then obviously when you look at it within the month i,
uh,a at the month of april you know there some uh slight improvement on the second half of april c but,mean at the month of april you know there s some slight improvement on the second half of april but,

uh,first quarter maybe some disruption uh from the perspective of uh in in europe particularly in italy uh i mean we,first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in europe particularly in italy but still not seeing that kind,
uh,the perspective of uh in in europe particularly in italy uh i mean we do have some very good manufacturing base,from the perspective of in europe particularly in italy but still not seeing that kind of recovery and we re,
uh,we do have some very good manufacturing base in italy uh and and and we although we stayed operationally i mean,we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate and second with the work we have done on proactive,
uh,i mean most of our suppliers had to shut down uh uh i i would say that uh now uh as,i mean i wouldn t you know i think at this point in time you could say you know 40,
uh,mean most of our suppliers had to shut down uh uh i i would say that uh now uh as kind,service during the what happened to us yeah what happened to us i would say this yeah yeah i think,
uh,to shut down uh uh i i would say that uh now uh as kind of the comment that i made,80 to 90 million of in year you know and i ll say that it s kind of consistent third,
uh,down uh uh i i would say that uh now uh as kind of the comment that i made before we,know and i ll say that it s kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter while the other roughly,
uh,of these lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized uh but uh but you know still you know not seeing,out with some of the headwinds but as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets,
uh,lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized uh but uh but you know still you know not seeing that uh,able to you know not only you know just a few years ago and there s just a lot of,
uh,uh but you know still you know not seeing that uh that kind of recovery and we re just kind of,of in europe particularly in italy but still not seeing that kind of recovery and we re just kind of,
uh,will will play out okay then switching over to the uh to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the,the recovery will play out okay and then switching over to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the,

uh,stiefel your line is open morning everyone morning nathan hey uh you know revenue down 8 6 x fx margins up,jones from steeple your line is open good morning everyone good morning revenue down 80 6 to xfx margins up,
uh,control lag on what drove the very good decremental there uh how do you say the decremental is going forward and,very good control lag on what drove the very good decrementals there how you see the decrementals going forward and,
uh,term margin opportunities in that business hey nathan this is uh uh uh you know i ll i ll say some,do you think the long term margin of opportunities in that business this is you know i would say some,

uh,suppliers in the market the team continued to execute those uh targets that they needed they needed needed to get done,supplement in the market the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done you know i,
uh,when when when when you look at this business that uh i mean has some very nice gross margins and uh,they needed to get done you know i think when you look at this business that and you know the,
uh,uh i mean has some very nice gross margins and uh you know the decremental the base decrementals are typically you,at this business that and you know the incremental the phase decrementals are typically you know 45 or so i,
uh,in order to get that decremental down to the 15 uh and i ll say you know from a long term,order to get the incremental down to the 15 and i ll say you know from a long term perspective,
uh,term perspective we ll we ll definitely come come back uh with with with giving some kind of medium to longterm,from a long term perspective we ll definitely come back with giving some kind of medium to long term perspective,
uh,then you can see that medical we were able to uh you know not not only you know just a few,comparison and you can see that medical we were able to you know not only you know just a few,

uh,you know as as we kind of get closer to uh coming out here to our budgets and how we kind,the headwinds but as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind,
uh,how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously uh to be at a minimum at bad days or more,how we can continue to get that incremental margin obviously be at a minimum of that days or more your,
uh,is open yeah hi good morning everybody good morning markus uh one more on the uh on the hi hi good,from credit suisse yeah hi good morning everybody i just want one more on the on the high high good,
uh,morning everybody good morning markus uh one more on the uh on the hi hi good morning uh on on synergies,hi good morning everybody i just want one more on the on the high high good morning on on synergies,
uh,more on the uh on the hi hi good morning uh on on synergies i i do appreciate that obviously procurement,want one more on the on the high high good morning on on synergies i do appreciate that obviously procurement,
uh,on synergies i i do appreciate that obviously procurement is uh volume dependent but um you flag your 10 to 20,on synergies i do appreciate that obviously procurement is a volume dependent but you flag here 10 to 20 million,
uh,start here yeah i think if you think about it uh 10 to 20 you know coming in uh in in,of the world there yeah josh i ll say more so in china if you want to think about it,
uh,about it uh 10 to 20 you know coming in uh in in in this year as you go into 2021,i wouldn t you know i think at this point in time you could say you know 40 to 50,
uh,go into 2021 assuming maybe kind of current volume levels uh it will be 20 to 40 million uh so that,back to about 20 maybe kind of current volume levels it ll be 20 to 40 million so that s,
uh,volume levels uh it will be 20 to 40 million uh so that s maybe at least uh that what you,of current volume levels it ll be 20 to 40 million so that s maybe at least that what you,
uh,to 40 million uh so that s maybe at least uh that what you can see here coming from wave one,20 to 40 million so that s maybe at least that what you can see here coming from wave one,
uh,covering you know a portion of the total span with uh ways two one way three coming off uh here in,covering you know a portion of the total spend with waves 2 and waves 3 coming up here in the,
uh,span with uh ways two one way three coming off uh here in the second half of the year right and,spend with waves 2 and waves 3 coming up here in the second half of the year i mean it,
uh,be much a little bit higher than that i mean uh i i i i wouldn t you know i think,mean it would definitely be a little bit higher than that i mean i wouldn t you know i think,
uh,you could say you know 40 to 50 could be uh upwards of 60 okay okay and then and then second,you could say you know 40 to 50 could be upwards of 16 okay okay and then second question on,
uh,sale share it it s relatively small compared to your uh company average but but but how do you think about,market you probably have a share of call it 15 in that space how do you think about this how,
uh,but but how do you think about this sort of uh it just struck me that it was it was slides,how do you think about this how does that segment look like in a few years i mean it s,
uh,we like a lot by the by the way that uh that th these businesses are kind of so kind of,this is a segment we like a lot by the way that these businesses are kind of so kind of,
uh,of so kind of niche and and very very solid uh market positions um and and it has just a load,of so kind of niche and very very solid market positions and it has just a lot descriptors such as,

uh,john walsh from credit suisse your line is open hi uh good morning sorry about that i had some technical difficulties,john walsh from credit suisse your line is open good morning sorry about that i had some technical difficulties earlier,
uh,doing well um you know maybe just one question here uh you alluded on the call to to share gains on,everyone s doing well you know maybe just one question here you alluded on the call to share gains on,
uh,the call to to share gains on kind of both uh the legacy gdi and and i our businesses um wondering,question here you alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both the legacy gdi and ir businesses,
uh,color you could provide there would be helpful sure johnny uh so e and and i categorize it i mean what,of the end market strategies you were doing previously around more niche markets i m not categorizing i mean what,
uh,is in the u s based on the third party uh report and and and and we liked it because it,liked is that this is in the u s based on the third party report and we liked it because,
uh,complimentary so if you look at the legacy gardner denver uh we sold some share takes in the low to medium,complimentary so if you look at the legacy garnet denver we saw some share takes in the low to medium,
uh,sold some share takes in the low to medium horsepower uh while we saw the ingersoll rand some shared take on,some share takes in the low to medium horsepower while we saw on the ingersoll run some share take on,
uh,launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower uh while as you know you know from a gardner denver,launching some new technology on the larger horsepower well as you know you know on this great merge and combining,
uh,small compressor and and i think you know this is uh what i mentioned on the call that this is a,i mean i think you know when we look at the inventory in those channels i mean there s just,
uh,a great hypothesis that we had on these great merge uh and and combining the two companies because now we have,well as you know you know on this great merge and combining the two companies because now we have great,
uh,have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that uh that you know a lot of these that i mentioned,two companies because now we have great new complementary products and spectrum of technologies that a lot of these that,
uh,of these that i mentioned is on the oil lubricated uh which is very good solid uh kind of corporate look,a lot of these that i mentioned is on the oil lubricated which is very good solid kind of core,
uh,on the oil lubricated uh which is very good solid uh kind of corporate look nine but as we spoke about,the oil lubricated which is very good solid kind of core product line but as we spoke about during the,
uh,s new technology new products and and be able to uh to to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the program,spectrum so again it s new technology new products and be able to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the,
uh,of differentiation on the program the teams are launching great uh i appreciate taking the question thank you john there re,of differentiation on the pros of the teams at luncheon great i appreciate taking the question there are no further,

uh,on the specifics of each region more than welcome juan uh from my part this is tomas restrepo um i would,on the specifics of each region and more than welcome one from my part i would just like to add,
uh,i would just like to add the impact of this uh energy cost reduction in on our variable costs in colombia,would just like to add that the impact of these energy cost reduction on a viable cost in colombia are,
uh,on our variable costs in colombia are very significant today uh our variable costs per ton including plants artificial at cartagena,on a viable cost in colombia are very significant as and it goes very very much lower you know in,
uh,others sealing wet process at yumbo so our our average uh variable cost in colombia is 20 and it goes very,of these energy cost reduction on a viable cost in colombia are very significant as and it goes very very,
uh,colombia is 20 and it goes very very much lower uh you know it sounds like cartagena for example so that,as and it goes very very much lower you know in terms like catahena for example so that is a,

uh,first quarter 202 so um simple terms a very good uh uh development in uh cash generation um in light i,into net cash of around 760 million which compares to roughly 900 million development in cash generation in light i,
uh,quarter 202 so um simple terms a very good uh uh development in uh cash generation um in light i think,net cash of around 760 million which compares to roughly 900 million development in cash generation in light i think,
uh,um simple terms a very good uh uh development in uh cash generation um in light i think of the decision,around 760 million which compares to roughly 900 million development in cash generation in light i think of the decision,
uh,of the decision and you have read it in the uh in the news today in light of the decision to,of the decision that you have read in the news 218 million just as a housekeeping topic here you re,
uh,today in light of the decision to propose the distribution uh of a dividend to the shareholders of for swiss franc,generation in light i think of the decision that you have read in the news 218 million just as a,
uh,of a dividend to the shareholders of for swiss franc uh we have calculated a pro forma net cash position at,of a very and quarter two and that the normalized years of 70 to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo,
uh,with 280 million um just as a housekeeping topic here uh you re aware that uh we have a revolving credit,218 million just as a housekeeping topic here you re aware that we have a a revolving credit facility available,
uh,as a housekeeping topic here uh you re aware that uh we have a revolving credit facility available to us which,as a housekeeping topic here you re aware that we have a a revolving credit facility available to us which,
uh,so nothing has been used so far in the extent uh or at the frame of 750 million um coming back,undrawn so nothing has been used so far in the extent or at the frame of 750 million coming back,
uh,at the frame of 750 million um coming back to uh the next item on the balance sheet uh asset held,at the frame of 750 million coming back to the next item on the balance sheet you have already calculated,
uh,back to uh the next item on the balance sheet uh asset held for sale also here information purposes this is,back to the next item on the balance sheet you have already calculated that yourself from december 23 6 percent,
uh,for sale also here information purposes this is the value uh that we have uh or or that is the scope,our volumes here spiked more than three times the normal volume that we see so this combination showed a certain,
uh,information purposes this is the value uh that we have uh or or that is the scope of the business that,from the investing activities the cross capex the run rates of the capex that we spend into the business is,
uh,of divestments with the xpo you can see a very uh transparent asset held for sale you can see a very,may so the figure you see is a never as of may so the figure you see is an average,
uh,transparent asset held for sale you can see a very uh transparent asset held for sale 400 million liabilities associated with,balance sheet here you see trade receivables have decreased over a year by around 400 million the reasons that i,
uh,assets held for sale 30 so the net asset value uh of that business to be carved out is around 100,out for sale i do not expect material impact on the pnl out of that it s going to be,
uh,ratio i m sure you have already calculated that yourself uh from december 23 6 an increase to 25 9 so,on the balance sheet you have already calculated that yourself from december 23 6 percent an increase to 25 9,
uh,23 6 an increase to 25 9 so i think uh the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these,percent an increase to 25 9 percent so i think the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these,
uh,also in these rough times and unusual times a benefit uh nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is,also in these rough times and unusual times benefit nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king,
uh,cash is cash is king um so main topic cash uh going uh swiftly to page number 1 um operational cash,is one thing cash is cash is king so main topic cash going swiftly to page number 19 operational cash,
uh,cash is king um so main topic cash uh going uh swiftly to page number 1 um operational cash flow you,thing cash is cash is king so main topic cash going swiftly to page number 19 operational cash flow you,
uh,2020 at around 804 million similar level than last year uh with with around 800 872 million um however when we,reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payment to the amount of 728 million so,
uh,million so comparatively at similar level free cash flow generation uh uh really what we are looking at very resilient the,million so comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient free cash,
uh,so comparatively at similar level free cash flow generation uh uh really what we are looking at very resilient the free,comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient free cash flow generation,
uh,quarter of 227 million which compares to 223 million so uh let s talk about crisis or a non crisis free,around 760 million which compares to roughly 900 million development in cash generation in light i think of the decision,
uh,or a non crisis free cash flow generation has been uh at the very same level as as uh as last,generation really what we are looking at very resilient free cash flow generation also in the second quarter is a,
uh,has been uh at the very same level as as uh as last year um excluding some of the disposals and,to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then do the question around,
uh,you a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary uh uh components are in there excluding the disposals the underlying,so there s a lot of caution is going forward how much we pay you can see that of the,
uh,a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary uh uh components are in there excluding the disposals the underlying free,a lot of caution is going forward how much we pay you can see that of the annual report we,
uh,the the the swing that we talked to you to uh uh uh disposals is um uh a very negligible i,the lower end of the range that we usually pursue the 80 to 100 swiss bank s tu ebit per,
uh,the the swing that we talked to you to uh uh uh disposals is um uh a very negligible i think,are looking at very resilient free cash flow generation also in the second quarter is a very neglectable i think,
uh,the swing that we talked to you to uh uh uh disposals is um uh a very negligible i think 6,looking at very resilient free cash flow generation also in the second quarter is a very neglectable i think 6,
uh,talked to you to uh uh uh disposals is um uh a very negligible i think 6 million out of the,free cash flow generation also in the second quarter is a very neglectable i think 6 million out of the,
uh,some of the some of the drivers of course is uh the contract logistics disposal of the of the uh of,from the effects of the pandemic the contract logistics ended the first semester with an ebit of 45 million swiss,
uh,is uh the contract logistics disposal of the of the uh of part of the uk business at the same time,of the smb sme business has not been the majority of the smb sme business has not been able to,
uh,we re also very diligently working on the usage of uh long term leases according to ifrs 16 rather than uh,we are not we are not selling on terms okay that s clear and the last one i didn t,
uh,uh long term leases according to ifrs 16 rather than uh uh outright purchases um looking at the pattern in time,we spend into the business is currently aiming at i ll try to purchase looking at the pattern in time,

uh,202 going to page number 20 and i only touched uh the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet um when,extraordinary impact in 2019 so we should expect a more touched the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet when,
uh,talked about the balance sheet here you see trade receivables uh have decreased uh uh over a year over year by,balance sheet when i talked about the balance sheet here you see trade receivables have decreased over a year by,

uh,keep especially on the dso sides days of sales outstanding uh a number around uh 54 5 so we have a,keep especially on the dso side days of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time,
uh,dso sides days of sales outstanding uh a number around uh 54 5 so we have a deviation of 0 4,dso side days of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time i think our focus,
uh,5 so we have a deviation of 0 4 days uh many uh questions coming along our away obviously in uh,long term leases so we have seen an increase in depreciation of right of depreciation loping also what does the,
uh,we have a deviation of 0 4 days uh many uh questions coming along our away obviously in uh is there,by that and the last question would just be an update on m a funds obviously you pay the dividend,
uh,uh many uh questions coming along our away obviously in uh is there pressure from customers on extended payment terms yes,talking and of course there is dso pressure are you currently of your customers so for longer payment terms or,
uh,pressure from customers on extended payment terms yes there is uh very clear yes there is but uh i think um,are you currently of your customers so for longer payment terms or something like that to keep them into to,
uh,yes there is uh very clear yes there is but uh i think um uh we will see more pressure coming,i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than three times the normal volume that we see so this combination,
uh,very clear yes there is but uh i think um uh we will see more pressure coming into third and fourth,believe that is anticipating a reflection of pressure on to risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters tax,
uh,will see more pressure coming into third and fourth quarter uh we are we are holding up uh uh quite well,to two day first quarter so we only if you like still a big number but a quarter so we,
uh,and fourth quarter uh we are we are holding up uh uh quite well i think uh service is one of,many of our peers we are not giving any you know i think the performance that the group has shown,
uh,fourth quarter uh we are we are holding up uh uh quite well i think uh service is one of the,the outlook with many of our peers we are not giving any you know i think the performance that the,
uh,we are holding up uh uh quite well i think uh service is one of the one of the important arguments,and dsos and dpos we were able to keep especially on the dso side days of sales outstanding important argument,
uh,is one of the one of the important arguments to uh to maintain uh uh the dsos at the same time,keep especially on the dso side days of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time,

uh,happened so far i want to underline that it s uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um,there is no reason to believe that that should look differently at least in the third quarter in the fourth,
uh,i want to underline that it s uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults,if you like until the point of closing that is the that is the simple reason why you have the,
uh,want to underline that it s uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or,tax rate i think very important to look at this one it s a housekeeping topic for you also to,
uh,to underline that it s uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or anything,like until the point of closing that is the that is the simple reason why you have the variances in,
uh,that it s uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or anything like that,as i said in my presentation until now no significant in defaults or fallouts or bankruptcies or anything like that,
uh,it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or anything like that but i would expect,i said in my presentation until now no significant in defaults or fallouts or bankruptcies or anything like that however,
uh,s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or anything like that but i would expect that,said in my presentation until now no significant in defaults or fallouts or bankruptcies or anything like that however the,
uh,but i would expect that the pressure is also here uh getting higher uh until the end of the year and,going to still be volatile explicit financial guidance for the group nor volume guidance until the end of the year,
uh,expect that the pressure is also here uh getting higher uh until the end of the year and maybe into the,volatile explicit financial guidance for the group nor volume guidance until the end of the year very sorry for that,

uh,we have as far as we can look ahead we uh initiate measures and activities and uh the rest is agility,again in contract logistics that means we have a cross profit related to that activity and the rest is lease,
uh,can look ahead we uh initiate measures and activities and uh the rest is agility adaptivity to a situation that you,maybe marks the whole year because in the pandemic is agility adaptivity to a situation that you can t really,
uh,let me start with the latter one because we have uh alluded to that a couple of times it s not,them and we had interaction virtually with all of them a couple of times throughout the week and months and,
uh,to us and that is etouch um market share gains uh we have mentioned that uh we were able to gain,the start of quarter two and i think we mentioned that when we when we had our quarter one analyst,
uh,etouch um market share gains uh we have mentioned that uh we were able to gain market share because we changed,in europe at the start of quarter two and i think we mentioned that when we when we had our,

uh,is the one that is under highest pressure technology connectivity uh and also uh functionability of operating systems is a big,able to counter the top line revenue pressure with cost measures almost entirely and that is for such a huge,
uh,that is under highest pressure technology connectivity uh and also uh functionability of operating systems is a big challenge for many,keep them into to your network and the last one is getting you to give us a guidance for any,
uh,don t convince by price we are a quality surpri uh uh supplier and the customers that have made the experience,not operational they struggled to clip operations up and running surprise supplier and the customers that have made the experience,

uh,but not only uh we have optimized uh our workforce uh we have uh reduced capacity where required but we shifted,but not only ppe but also package food as well as e commerce volumes went into that segment parachubists were,
uh,uh we have optimized uh our workforce uh we have uh reduced capacity where required but we shifted capacity to those,we have a cross profit related to that activity and the rest is lease cost and our idle capacity has,
uh,is no rule we have only a few temporary labor uh i think it s 2 000 a bit more than,of the year whether at the moment at the moment i think it s 90 if i m not mistaken,
uh,000 temp labor less than we had a year ago uh and this is uh driven by the effect that we,were maintained and europe now is slowly recovering while the the americas are still suffering from the effects of the,
uh,than we had a year ago uh and this is uh driven by the effect that we see much higher demand,the the americas are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic the contract logistics ended the first semester with,
uh,much higher demand still in some of the essential goods uh segments especially uh pharma healthcare and um e commerce and,lot of efforts with all the programs that are in place but not only pharma healthcare and e commerce and,

uh,kerstens from jefferies please go ahead thank you good afternoon uh gentlemen uh three questions please from my side first on,i hope that answers your questions thank you good afternoon gentlemen three questions please from my side first on on,
uh,jefferies please go ahead thank you good afternoon uh gentlemen uh three questions please from my side first on uh on,i hope that answers your questions thank you good afternoon gentlemen three questions please from my side first on on,
uh,gentlemen uh three questions please from my side first on uh on sea logistics it turns out that the uh volume,good afternoon gentlemen three questions please from my side first on on sea logistics it turns out that the volume,
uh,on uh on sea logistics it turns out that the uh volume development uh is uh is better than expected as,from my side first on on sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as,
uh,sea logistics it turns out that the uh volume development uh is uh is better than expected as the quarter progressed,first on on sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as the quarter progressed,
uh,it turns out that the uh volume development uh is uh is better than expected as the quarter progressed i was,sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as the quarter progressed and i was,
uh,you benefited from i think in constant currency a 34 uh high yield and now with uh the airfreight market starting,to the lack of capacity in air freight 34 higher yield and now with the air freight market starting to,
uh,constant currency a 34 uh high yield and now with uh the airfreight market starting to normalize again would you expect,in air freight 34 higher yield and now with the air freight market starting to normalize again would you expect,
uh,i think the organic revenue was down 20 in the uh second quarter but that s a mix of of europe,i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two different reasons to that includes a,
uh,um yes we had a better volume development than expected uh but uh any shift from air to sea is insignificant,logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as the quarter progressed and i was wondering,
uh,we had a better volume development than expected uh but uh any shift from air to sea is insignificant for sea,out that the volume development is better than expected as the quarter progressed and i was wondering did you see,
uh,so yeah one freighter has 100 has 100 kilos and uh uh 100 tons and uh we are talking about i,the amount of 728 million so comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at,
uh,yeah one freighter has 100 has 100 kilos and uh uh 100 tons and uh we are talking about i don,main trigger for any decision in either way second one is you are talking and of course there is dso,
uh,100 has 100 kilos and uh uh 100 tons and uh we are talking about i don t know uh six,of the time back to back with customers where we say we have a five or i don t know,
uh,and uh we are talking about i don t know uh six eight containers uh so it s a different business,that you indicated in your presentation so let me answer your questions see logistics so it s a different business,
uh,talking about i don t know uh six eight containers uh so it s a different business model you can t,your presentation so let me answer your questions see logistics so it s a different business model you can t,
uh,distribution even to south america via air and this combination uh this solution um is in in light of the lacking,combination south america via air and this combination this solution in light of the lacking supply side of radar capacity,
uh,the lacking supply side of freighter capacity especially in china uh got a lot of uh tailwind and uh i mentioned,lacking supply side of radar capacity especially in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes,
uh,freighter capacity especially in china uh got a lot of uh tailwind and uh i mentioned that uh our volumes here,radar capacity especially in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than,
uh,in china uh got a lot of uh tailwind and uh i mentioned that uh our volumes here spiked uh more,of radar capacity especially in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more,
uh,a lot of uh tailwind and uh i mentioned that uh our volumes here spiked uh more than three times the,in china got a lot of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than three times the,
uh,and uh i mentioned that uh our volumes here spiked uh more than three times the normal volume that we see,of tailwind and i mentioned that our volumes here spiked more than three times the normal volume that we see,
uh,volume that we see so this combination showed a certain uh progress air logistics um i think i mentioned that during,normal volume that we see so this combination showed a certain progress air logistics i think i mentioned that during,
uh,the presentation we expect especially in the second semester that uh higher yield was a very special or was was a,the presentation we expect especially in the second semester that the higher yield was a very special or was a,
uh,the normalized yield of 70 to chf85 per hundred kilo uh will come in or will kick in uh again gradually,the normalized years of 70 to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will come in gradually started already as of,
uh,hundred kilo uh will come in or will kick in uh again gradually not overnight and not uh on a on,there but in europe this will take time it will not come overnight at the moment the pandemic is hitting,
uh,will kick in uh again gradually not overnight and not uh on a on a fingertip but uh gradually um road,will take time it will not come overnight at the moment the pandemic is hitting the americas and we see,
uh,overnight and not uh on a on a fingertip but uh gradually um road logistics um i think uh our comps,dso side days of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time i think our focus,
uh,fingertip but uh gradually um road logistics um i think uh our comps are uh we we have so many different,see logistics so it s a different business model you can t compare it but what we saw is and,
uh,um road logistics um i think uh our comps are uh we we have so many different figures in the market,you can talk about that yeah we monitor the market for many years and we are active in the market,
uh,has happened or described really what has happened is um uh i think what we have to all all of us,air freight can be described by just make it happen make it happen times where customers as much as on,
uh,all all of us have to be very careful with uh let let me describe a a situation that we experienced,you will have to or we we will all have to live with guess working and a bit of that,
uh,then this bottomed out and the recovery gradually started already uh as of may so the figure you see is an,come in gradually started already as of may so the figure you see is a never as of may so,
uh,may so the figure you see is an average figure uh as of may so the figure you see is an,may so the figure you see is a never as of may so the figure you see is an average,
uh,figure of a volume development that had a lot of uh slumps and spikes and a lot of of shifts uh,an average figure of a volume development that had a lot of slumps and spikes and a lot of ships,
uh,uh slumps and spikes and a lot of of shifts uh over the last week at the moment i or we,slumps and spikes and a lot of ships over the last week at the moment i or we all believe,
uh,question comes from sam bland from jpmorgan please go ahead uh afternoon uh can i ask i think three questions please,question comes from sam bland from jp morgan please go ahead good afternoon could i ask i think three questions,
uh,from sam bland from jpmorgan please go ahead uh afternoon uh can i ask i think three questions please the first,sam bland from jp morgan please go ahead good afternoon could i ask i think three questions please the first,
uh,think three questions please the first one is on the uh seafreight conversion rate that s held up um pretty well,i ask i think three questions please the first one is on the cfrate conversion rate that s held up,
uh,cost savings programs in seafreight or what what helped the uh conversion rate in the quarter um second question is on,that as it relates to gp deploy over the medium term and then the second question and i guess it,
uh,question is on i think there was 57 million of uh employee government support in the quarter could you just talk,question it s personal cost is the main factor and we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics,
uh,um and and your your profitability is impacted by that uh and the last question will just be an update on,basically a lag and your profitability is impacted by that and the last question would just be an update on,
uh,time now to look at that thank you okay sam uh by the way guys you can also ask less than,time to look at that thank you at the short end to you so see we have cost savings in,
uh,routine that you have to ask three questions only as uh as uh as assorted to you so see uh we,still got plenty of time to look at that thank you at the short end to you so see we,
uh,you have to ask three questions only as uh as uh as assorted to you so see uh we have cost,plenty of time to look at that thank you at the short end to you so see we have cost,
uh,as uh as uh as assorted to you so see uh we have cost savings in place and there s no,you at the short end to you so see we have cost savings in place and there s no e,

uh,contract logistics but people were out of work so as uh volumes are coming back also in the normal operation people,to contract logistics but people were out of work so as volumes are coming back and we pay them so,
uh,people which is beneficial for our staff and also for uh for the government uh related to this so the business,off people which is beneficial for our staff and also for the government related to this this so the business,
uh,for our staff and also for uh for the government uh related to this so the business the operational run rate,beneficial for our staff and also for the government related to this this so the business the operational run rate,
uh,contract logistics will will phoenix like come back out of uh all the restructuring activities and your question related to m,like come back out of all the restructuring activities and your question related to m a ambition i m a,
uh,cash flow is strong and we weathered the situation strongly uh we are we are uh in a situation that uh,that cash flow is strong and we whether the situation strongly we are we are in a situation that the,
uh,we weathered the situation strongly uh we are we are uh in a situation that uh the board of directors decided,strong and we whether the situation strongly we are we are in a situation that the board of directors decided,
uh,uh we are we are uh in a situation that uh the board of directors decided to propose for the uh,the situation strongly we are we are in a situation that the board of directors decided to propose for the,
uh,uh the board of directors decided to propose for the uh gener uh to propose the same dividend again for the,situation that the board of directors decided to propose for the general to propose the same dividend again for the,
uh,board of directors decided to propose for the uh gener uh to propose the same dividend again for the general assembly,the board of directors decided to propose for the general to propose the same dividend again for the general assembly,
uh,at the moment so whatever we do is based on uh video calls okay understood thank you you re welcome the,general assembly at the moment so whatever we do is based on video calls thank you you re welcome you,
uh,of your airfreight in q2 went in freighters rather than uh belly hold and and do you see that changing significantly,air freight and capacity question could you give us a sense belly hold and do you see that changing significantly,
uh,sense is that you know the airlines are bringing back uh capacity but much more of it is short and medium,senses that you know the airlines are bringing back capacity but much more of it is short and medium hole,
uh,use exactly so whatever belly comes back at the moment uh it s short and medium haul and that doesn t,what you use at the moment it s short and medium haul and that doesn t help us i mean,
uh,medium haul and that doesn t help us i mean uh usually that is not where we where we uh uh,medium haul and that doesn t help us i mean usually that is not where we and transact the majority,
uh,mean uh usually that is not where we where we uh uh transact the majority of our business yeah so i,mean usually that is not where we and transact the majority of our business so i would expect in the,
uh,uh usually that is not where we where we uh uh transact the majority of our business yeah so i would,usually that is not where we and transact the majority of our business so i would expect in the second,
uh,business yeah so i would expect in the second semester uh 60 to 70 of all volume to be transported with,business so i would expect in the second semester 60 to 70 percent of our volume to be transported with,
uh,to be transported with freighters main deck capacity yeah and uh belly will not recover too soon i would say it,our volume to be transported with freighters main deck capacity and belly will not recover too soon i would say,
uh,soon i would say it will take maybe two years uh that we see a significant uh network uh activity which,recover too soon i would say it will take maybe two years that we see a significant network activity which,
uh,take maybe two years uh that we see a significant uh network uh activity which allows for uh belly uh using,would say it will take maybe two years that we see a significant network activity which allows for belly using,
uh,two years uh that we see a significant uh network uh activity which allows for uh belly uh using belly capacity,it will take maybe two years that we see a significant network activity which allows for belly using belly capacity,
uh,see a significant uh network uh activity which allows for uh belly uh using belly capacity again yeah um yeah and,two years that we see a significant network activity which allows for belly using belly capacity again yeah go ahead,
uh,significant uh network uh activity which allows for uh belly uh using belly capacity again yeah um yeah and i and,significant network activity which allows for belly using belly capacity again yeah go ahead the 60 to 70 percent that,
uh,sure so this this is no so the no no uh mark i m i m not sure end of this,sme so that gives you a bit of a flavor it s a result of the pandemic and not of,
uh,end of this year we will have 60 to 70 uh of the belly capacity that should be back oh okay,compared to what 90 95 in q2 because there was so little belly capacity around on freighter capacity to a,
uh,is freighter capacity so we have a lot of um uh belly still in north america or the americas which can,is greater capacity so we have a lot of bellies still in north america or the americas which can be,
uh,in north america or the americas which can be used uh and we use partially uh belly capacity for perishables uh,still in north america or the americas which can be used and we use partially belly capacity for perishables out,
uh,americas which can be used uh and we use partially uh belly capacity for perishables uh out of uh african countries,america or the americas which can be used and we use partially belly capacity for perishables out of african countries,
uh,uh and we use partially uh belly capacity for perishables uh out of uh african countries yeah so so when you,and we use partially belly capacity for perishables out of african countries the longer term range that s much more,
uh,use partially uh belly capacity for perishables uh out of uh african countries yeah so so when you talk about the,use partially belly capacity for perishables out of african countries the longer term range that s much more the mix,
uh,thanks mark that i also got a question once so uh very good yey laugh no credit insurance uh uh a,use it thanks mark that i i also got a question once it s our way hey no credit insurance,
uh,once so uh very good yey laugh no credit insurance uh uh a very interesting topic right now uh and without,s our way hey no credit insurance i m very interested in copying right now and without disclosing goes well,

uh,uh a very interesting topic right now uh and without uh disclosing too much details you know that we work with,our way hey no credit insurance i m very interested in copying right now and without disclosing goes well there,
uh,that we work with the the two main credit issuers uh on a global basis there are a lot of conversations,the horizon is a bit darker than what it usually looks like so there s a lot of caution is,
uh,are we are having a good partnership with them and uh and we try to manage as much uh coverage as,very quickly but we are having a good partnership with them and we try to manage as much coverage as,
uh,them and uh and we try to manage as much uh coverage as possible as i said in my presentation until,partnership with them and we try to manage as much coverage as possible as i said in my presentation until,

uh,around 3 5 million to 4 million on insurance premium uh i think that is given our sales ledger of uh,around three and a half to four million on insurance premium i think that is given our sales ledger of,

uh,increasing risk to some of your sme customers just wondering uh as it pertains to seafreight uh and the negative mix,so the first one marcus you obviously customers just wondering as it pertains to see fright and the negative mix,
uh,sme customers just wondering uh as it pertains to seafreight uh and the negative mix effect on gp per teu uh,marcus you obviously customers just wondering as it pertains to see fright and the negative mix effect on gp pertoy,
uh,uh and the negative mix effect on gp per teu uh as you plan beyond 2020 do you plan for a,see fright and the negative mix effect on gp pertoy as you plan beyond 2020 do you plan for a,
uh,to normal or how do you think about that and uh as it relates to gp per teu over the medium,smes relative to normal or how do you think about that as it relates to gp deploy over the medium,
uh,this to your m a ambitions that you obviously outlined uh to an extent of the full year i guess on,is this to your m a ambitions that you obviously outlined to an extent at the full year i guess,
uh,our own business based on airlog and followed by sealog uh and the etouch ability of that business uh make etouch,our own business based on airlock and followed by c lock and the e touchability of that business make e,
uh,by sealog uh and the etouch ability of that business uh make etouch happen and and we make progress here we,by c lock and the e touchability of that business make e touch happen and we make progress here in,
uh,etouch happen and and we make progress here we re uh in in airlog logistics as we as we have uh,e touch happen and we make progress here in air logistic as we have pronounced certain asian customers a solution,
uh,uh in in airlog logistics as we as we have uh pronounced um m a is independent of this this needs,here in air logistic as we have pronounced certain asian customers a solution that is not yet part of our,
uh,fit we are looking for access to certain asian customers uh a solutioning that is not yet part of our own,we have pronounced certain asian customers a solution that is not yet part of our own solution maybe so there,
uh,so there are a lot of other criteria and yes uh it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly,so there are a lot of other criteria and yes it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly,
uh,proven that this is not a big exercise for us uh so that is not a criteria that would influence our,have proven that this is not a big exercise for us so that is not a criteria that would mna,
uh,a criteria that would influence our m a approach or uh delay any m a it s more um getting acquainted,a criteria that would mna approach or delay any mna it s more getting acquainted to those targets and also,
uh,s more um getting acquainted to those ha i mean uh uh targets and also building up a basis of trust,or delay any mna it s more getting acquainted to those targets and also building up a basis of trust,
uh,more um getting acquainted to those ha i mean uh uh targets and also building up a basis of trust and,delay any mna it s more getting acquainted to those targets and also building up a basis of trust and,
uh,s a two years exercise it doesn t happen overnight uh but we make progress we never stopped we didn t,two years extra it doesn t happen overnight but we make progress we never stopped we didn t change approach,
uh,that point of view i m quite confident that eventually uh we will be able to announce the right or the,from that point of view i m quite confident or the right acquisitions so neil then on the first question,
uh,the right or the right acquisitions um so neil then uh on the first question i i think it s interesting,i m quite confident or the right acquisitions so neil then on the first question i think it s interesting,
uh,the working capital and the risk profile to the sme uh i i think we see now the smes volumes coming,the working capital and the risk profile to the sme right now so it s an absolute attractive and we,
uh,a simple reason because most of the businesses have been uh due to the curfews have been have been just shut,the smb sme business has not been the majority of the smb sme business has not been able to sustain,
uh,due to the curfews have been have been just shut uh uh uh that doesn t mean they reopen again so,quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then do,
uh,to the curfews have been have been just shut uh uh uh that doesn t mean they reopen again so i,to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then do the question around,
uh,the curfews have been have been just shut uh uh uh that doesn t mean they reopen again so i think,what you use at the moment it s short and medium haul and that doesn t help us i mean,
uh,that doesn t mean they reopen again so i think uh what we are looking at in seafreight is that temporarily,what does the main trigger for any decision in either way second one is you are talking and of course,
uh,s even going to be a bigger portion you know uh we have an extremely whe when you look at the,looking at the pattern in time the trajectory of the free cash flow i think when you look at the,
uh,a very small market share we cover right now so uh it s it s an absolute attractive and we re,working capital and the risk profile to the sme right now so it s an absolute attractive and we re,
uh,is this is our backbone of our operation right um uh uh there is still a a massive potential to grow,base to the sme customer this is our backbone of our operation there is still a massive potential to grow,
uh,this is our backbone of our operation right um uh uh there is still a a massive potential to grow in,to the sme customer this is our backbone of our operation there is still a massive potential to grow in,
uh,so um how the margin is going to look like uh uh i i think also here there is a time,in the sma so how the margin is going to look like i think also here there is a time,
uh,um how the margin is going to look like uh uh i i think also here there is a time that,the sma so how the margin is going to look like i think also here there is a time that,
uh,at for the normalization but there there is no systemic uh structural reason why the margin for sme should have uh,to look at for the normalization but there is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should be,
uh,uh structural reason why the margin for sme should have uh uh should uh should be lower than it has been,normalization but there is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should be lower than it has been,
uh,structural reason why the margin for sme should have uh uh should uh should be lower than it has been in,normalization but there is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should be lower than it has been,
uh,why the margin for sme should have uh uh should uh should be lower than it has been in the past,is no systemic structural reason why the margin for sme should be lower than it has been in the past,
uh,than it has been in the past so i think uh uh rightfully so uh uh our our backbone sme customer,sme should be lower than it has been in the past so i think rightfully so our backbone sme customer,
uh,it has been in the past so i think uh uh rightfully so uh uh our our backbone sme customer base,should be lower than it has been in the past so i think rightfully so our backbone sme customer base,
uh,in the past so i think uh uh rightfully so uh uh our our backbone sme customer base we will even,than it has been in the past so i think rightfully so our backbone sme customer base we will even,
uh,the past so i think uh uh rightfully so uh uh our our backbone sme customer base we will even get,the past so i think rightfully so our backbone sme customer base we will even get a bigger portion of,
uh,you very much good afternoon um also a question regarding uh the mix shift in sea towards sme um could you,ahead thank you very much good afternoon also a question regarding the mix shift in c towards sme could you,
uh,sea business i think those details we will not disclose uh but the majority of the smb sme business has not,sea business i think those details we will not disclose but the majority of the smb sme business has not,
uh,basis their their their financial savviness is not given yeah uh and sme is everything be careful now it s uh,their basis their financial sadness is not given and sme is everything the air folder it s it s also,
uh,uh and sme is everything be careful now it s uh it s also very niche products uh that has not,not given and sme is everything the air folder it s it s also very niche products that has not,
uh,now it s uh it s also very niche products uh that has not seen an increase in demand at the,air folder it s it s also very niche products that has not seen an increase in demand at the,
uh,at the moment yeah whether you have hand painted tiles uh that are produced in northern italy and the demand is,at the moment the pandemic is hitting the americas and we see that we have still volumes that are down,
uh,and we are strong in sme business our business is uh skewed uh towards smes so that gives you a bit,business is and we are strong in sme business our business is stood towards sme so that gives you a,
uh,are strong in sme business our business is uh skewed uh towards smes so that gives you a bit of a,are strong in sme business our business is stood towards sme so that gives you a bit of a flavor,
uh,final question is around the m a market and whether uh the troub i mean you mentioned that you re winning,of a shift in the mix you saw and what was the effect on the yield that you saw in,
uh,are losing it are typically the small or mid sized uh um competitors uh that are having difficulties on the technology,is typically what you use at the moment it s short and medium haul and that doesn t help us,
uh,are typically the small or mid sized uh um competitors uh that are having difficulties on the technology front connectivity and,is typically what you use at the moment it s short and medium haul and that doesn t help us,
uh,and and you also talk about the um credit risks uh escalating so there might be an an uptick in the,maybe you can talk about that yeah we monitor the market for many years and we are active in the,
uh,an uptick in the m a opportunities that you see uh maybe you can talk about that yeah we monitor the,an uptake in the m a opportunities that you see maybe you can talk about that yeah we monitor the,
uh,that yeah we monitor the market for many years and uh we are we are active in the market and as,can talk about that yeah we monitor the market for many years and we are active in the market as,
uh,growth paths that we have embarked on many years ago uh we don t need m a what we we have,continue our growth path that we have embarked on many years ago we don t need mna what we have,
uh,and if we find targets that are um fulfilling those uh requirements we will be acti we will become active and,achieve with an m a approach and if we find targets that are fulfilling those requirements we will become active,
uh,us the market has not significantly changed at the moment uh and we never uh looked at we always looked at,products that has not seen an increase in demand at the moment march is coming back now in denmark for,
uh,not significantly changed at the moment uh and we never uh looked at we always looked at targets uh also in,has not changed to the one that we made prior to covid 19 when we posted our annual results 2019,
uh,we never uh looked at we always looked at targets uh also in the past that were successful in their with,the free cash flow i think when you look at the curves on the page 19 on the right side,
uh,business model in their geography geography or in their solutioning uh we are not looking for a restructuring case that s,business model and our efforts to optimally variableize a meaningful portion of our short term fixed cost and looking at,
uh,yes hello i have some small technical questions one is uh concerning the decision concerning capex or long term leases so,are fulfilling those requirements we will become active and if not we don t so long term leases so we,
uh,we have seen an increase in depreciation of right of uh depreciation of right of use assets from two hundred uh,we have seen an increase in depreciation of right of depreciation loping also what does the main trigger for any,
uh,uh depreciation of right of use assets from two hundred uh thirty seven to two hundred fif uh fifty four uh,in depreciation of right of depreciation loping also what does the main trigger for any decision in either way second,
uh,from two hundred uh thirty seven to two hundred fif uh fifty four uh million in the second quarter uh this,right with you that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two,
uh,uh thirty seven to two hundred fif uh fifty four uh million in the second quarter uh this year and uh,you that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two different reasons,
uh,fif uh fifty four uh million in the second quarter uh this year and uh so what is the the the,quite high in the second quarter is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure of that region so,
uh,uh million in the second quarter uh this year and uh so what is the the the trigger for a decision,costs and the other one sg a have contributed to this development in the second quarter and the other question,
uh,and how is the current market for long term leases uh developing also what is the main trigger for any decision,have seen an increase in depreciation of right of depreciation loping also what does the main trigger for any decision,
uh,trigger for any decision in either way second one is uh you are talking and of course there is dso pressure,trigger for any decision in either way second one is you are talking and of course there is dso pressure,
uh,you are talking and of course there is dso pressure uh are you currently supporting some of your customers uh so,one is you are talking and of course there is dso pressure are you currently of your customers so for,
uh,pressure uh are you currently supporting some of your customers uh so for longer payment terms or something like that to,there is dso pressure are you currently of your customers so for longer payment terms or something like that to,

uh,of income from disposals in the second half thank you uh well christian right of use assets uh i i i,of income from this pauses in the second half thank you so christian right with you that s it i,
uh,half thank you uh well christian right of use assets uh i i i think your question has uh two answers,the second half thank you so christian right with you that s it i think your question has two answers,
uh,use assets uh i i i think your question has uh two answers the first one is uh what is the,so christian right with you that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there,
uh,your question has uh two answers the first one is uh what is the decision making uh reasons to it and,your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two different reasons to that includes a few assets,
uh,the first one is uh what is the decision making uh reasons to it and the second one is what is,had a formal rich and dividend policy as it is all decision making power remains with the board of directors,
uh,reasons to it and the second one is what is uh the increase uh in the second quarter uh there are,christian right with you that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are,
uh,and the second one is what is uh the increase uh in the second quarter uh there are there are two,that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two different reasons to,
uh,what is uh the increase uh in the second quarter uh there are there are two different there are two different,that s it i think your question has two answers in the second quarter there are two different reasons to,
uh,are two different there are two different reasons to that uh the maybe the more technical first you know that we,there are two different reasons to that includes a few assets and as per the ifrs standards you have to,
uh,maybe the more technical first you know that we have uh the asset held for sale related to the disposal of,we had over the last years you know that we never had a formal rich and dividend policy as it,
uh,as per the ifrs standards you have to stop depreciations uh uh at the point of signing and then uh keep,assets and as per the ifrs standards you have to stop depreciations at the point of signing and then keep,

uh,and then uh keep that frozen if you like until uh the point of closing that is the that is the,signing and then keep that frozen if you like until the point of closing that is the that is the,
uh,second quarter and continue to have until closing has been uh uh has been executed so that is the technical part,second quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then,
uh,quarter and continue to have until closing has been uh uh has been executed so that is the technical part then,second quarter and continue to have until closing has been has been executed so that is the technical part then,
uh,that is the technical part then the the question around uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the,executed so that is the technical part then do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the,
uh,is the technical part then the the question around uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other,is the technical part then do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other parent to,
uh,then the the question around uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other brand uh uh what,then do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other parent to keep our flexibility most,
uh,makes us uh deciding into one or the other brand uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the,the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other parent to keep our flexibility most of the,
uh,us uh deciding into one or the other brand uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other,so that is the technical part then do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other,
uh,one or the other brand uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other pays um main uh,that is the technical part then do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other parent,
uh,uh deciding into one or the other pays um main uh main and most important piece to it is uh is,us deciding into one or the other parent to keep our flexibility most of the time back to back with,
uh,main uh main and most important piece to it is uh is that because we talk most of it of locations,and we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics that means we have a cross profit related to,
uh,because we talk most of it of locations right of uh of contract logistics facilities right mm hmm affirmative so what,we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics that means we have a cross profit related to that,
uh,that a facility that is an operational optimal position then uh then obviously we want to keep our flexibility most of,do the question around what makes us deciding into one or the other parent to keep our flexibility most of,
uh,or i don t know a 10 years customer contract uh you know i m just making an example and we,five or i don t know ten years customer contract you know i m just making an example and we,
uh,our lease commitments it s flexibility that is that is uh that is driving our asset life business model right so,our latest communication this is just reflecting on your models right sides the four business units you see the first,
uh,that is driving our asset life business model right so uh if you ask us you know then uh each answer,latest communication this is just reflecting on your models right sides the four business units you see the first line,
uh,right so uh if you ask us you know then uh each answer is going to be the more flexible the,the us i think we are and it s recovering ok great thank you very much you re welcome the,

uh,ahead hi um okay is it possible for you to uh quantify the benefit from your perishables in air uh gp,america please go ahead hi is it possible for you to quantify the benefit from lower perishables in air gp,
uh,to uh quantify the benefit from your perishables in air uh gp into teu as well as the uh impact on,to quantify the benefit from lower perishables in air gp in 2q as well as the impact on volume from,
uh,in air uh gp into teu as well as the uh impact on volumes from lower perishables and so as that,from lower perishables in air gp in 2q as well as the impact on volume from lower perishables as that,
uh,then secondly what have you seen from the digital forwarders uh uh during the covid crisis and have you seen a,from lower perishables as that normalizes how we should be thinking to their covid crisis and have you seen a,
uh,secondly what have you seen from the digital forwarders uh uh during the covid crisis and have you seen a higher,as that normalizes how we should be thinking to their covid crisis and have you seen a higher or more,
uh,let me let me answer your question laugh okay okay uh the the the latter question i don t know what,presence from them during the crisis okay let me answer your question the letter question i don t know what,
uh,latter question i don t know what digital forwarders are uh but uh i would believe our digital solutions got a,letter question i don t know what digital forewaters are in general being active or aggressive in the market i,
uh,i don t know what digital forwarders are uh but uh i would believe our digital solutions got a lot of,i don t know what digital forewaters are in general being active or aggressive in the market i would say,
uh,would believe our digital solutions got a lot of pickup uh during the crisis we have not seen many of our,s not a one time shot and in the us i think we are and it s recovering ok great,
uh,and i m not exaggerating so um i will not uh name any and i will not uh give any comments,somehow disappeared and i m not exaggerating so i will not name any and i will not give any comments,
uh,i will not uh name any and i will not uh give any comments on on single forwarders um the quantification,not exaggerating so i will not name any and i will not give any comments on single forewaters the quantification,
uh,from perishables first of all perishable is a a low uh low margin uh business and we had uh less perishables,from lower perishables in air gp in 2q as well as the impact on volume from lower perishables as that,
uh,of all perishable is a a low uh low margin uh business and we had uh less perishables uh uh one,not give any comments on single forewaters the quantification of the benefits from perishables one third less perishables in the,
uh,a low uh low margin uh business and we had uh less perishables uh uh one third less approximately volume one,will not give any comments on single forewaters the quantification of the benefits from perishables one third less perishables in,
uh,low margin uh business and we had uh less perishables uh uh one third less approximately volume one third less perishables,from lower perishables in air gp in 2q as well as the impact on volume from lower perishables as that,
uh,margin uh business and we had uh less perishables uh uh one third less approximately volume one third less perishables in,from lower perishables in air gp in 2q as well as the impact on volume from lower perishables as that,
uh,um with a lower yield so the 70 to 85 uh swiss francs per hundred kilo uh will become uh uh,the mix would reinstate with a lower yield so the 70 to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will become,
uh,the 70 to 85 uh swiss francs per hundred kilo uh will become uh uh a reality also all uh because,with a lower yield so the 70 to 85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will become reality also all because,
uh,85 uh swiss francs per hundred kilo uh will become uh uh a reality also all uh because of the cargo,85 swiss francs per 100 kilo will become reality also all because of the cargo mix with one volume being,
uh,uh swiss francs per hundred kilo uh will become uh uh a reality also all uh because of the cargo mix,swiss francs per 100 kilo will become reality also all because of the cargo mix with one volume being perishable,
uh,kilo uh will become uh uh a reality also all uh because of the cargo mix it was one third of,kilo will become reality also all because of the cargo mix with one volume being perishable i hope that helps,
uh,it was one third of our total volume being being uh perishable i hope that helps i hope that helps thank,one volume being perishable i hope that helps i hope that helps thank you you re welcome the last question,
uh,from ubs please go ahead hello i got two questions uh the first one would be on a contract logistics you,jp morgan please go ahead good afternoon could i ask i think three questions please the first one is on,
uh,be on a contract logistics you mentioned there your cost uh expenses came down quite a fair bit i was wondering,are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic the contract logistics ended the first semester with an ebit of,
uh,contributed to this development in the second quarter and um uh the other question i have if i calculated correctly your,contributed to this development in the second quarter and the other question i have if i calculated correctly your conversion,
uh,particular in asia was quite high in the second quarter uh is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure,particular in asia was quite high in the second quarter is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure,
uh,mode exposure of that region so sebastian first of all uh we don t look at conversion rates per region because,mode exposure of that region so sebastian first of all we don t look at conversion rates per region because,
uh,we don t look at conversion rates per region because uh it depends on the terms our customers apply on where,we don t look at conversion rates per region because it depends on the terms our customers apply on where,
uh,depends on the terms our customers apply on where to uh you know invoice and and pay uh transport bills uh,region because it depends on the terms our customers apply on where to you know invoice and pay transport bills,
uh,on where to uh you know invoice and and pay uh transport bills uh so it s skewed be careful um,on where to you know invoice and pay transport bills so it s cute the question on contract logistics and,
uh,uh you know invoice and and pay uh transport bills uh so it s skewed be careful um we have a,the terms our customers apply on where to you know invoice and pay transport bills so it s cute the,
uh,skewed be careful um we have a we have a uh profit sharing models or that is within or internally between,mean we have proven that this is not a big exercise for us so that is not a criteria that,
uh,really help um conversion rate for sure is influenced by uh the performance of the different business units and yes in,minus 15 5 percent how does this please translate now into the unit performance of the business units and please,
uh,of the different business units and yes in quarter two uh airfreight or air logistics has been extremely successful um the,so the business the operational run rate of contract logistics has been extremely strong all the restructuring measures showed the,
uh,airfreight or air logistics has been extremely successful um the uh and the question on contract logistics and cost development the,you know invoice and pay transport bills so it s cute the question on contract logistics and cost development the,
uh,development the majority of the cost is people colleagues and uh the second cost factor is lease i gave an answer,development the majority of the cost is people colleagues and the second cost factor is lease i gave an answer,
uh,lease i gave an answer on the lease already because uh 50 or a bit more of our uh contracts are,factor is lease i gave an answer on the lease already because 50 or a bit more of our contracts,
uh,already because uh 50 or a bit more of our uh contracts are all back to back uh dedicated with single,already because 50 or a bit more of our contracts all back to back we dedicate it with single customers,
uh,more of our uh contracts are all back to back uh dedicated with single customer so the fixed cost coverage is,bit more of our contracts all back to back we dedicate it with single customers so the fixed cost coverage,
uh,the fixed cost coverage is usually part of our contracts uh so that is not an exposure and the rest is,the fixed cost coverage is usually situation and that is exactly what we see many of the operations are back,
uh,so that is not an exposure and the rest is uh capacity and we breezed um with the volume very well,and they stay it s not a one time shot and in the us i think we are and it,
uh,situation that would that is limited by time you know uh it would not uh end up in a in a,situation and that is exactly what we see many of the operations are back i mentioned that only 12 operations,
uh,is limited by time you know uh it would not uh end up in a in a permanent situation and that,active in the market as you know but not everything that looks shiny is of interest for us and that,
uh,is fully operational or has started to become operational again uh maybe not a three shift operation or weekend shifts uh,is fully operational or a we can learn from china or asia because they went through this pandemic very early,
uh,uh maybe not a three shift operation or weekend shifts uh but if you look into china and china is maybe,has not been able to sustain their operations four six weeks and that has caused the reduction so but we,
uh,they went through this pandemic very early and and gradually uh we have full employment in our operations in china uh,they went through this pandemic very early and gradually we have full employment in our operations in china production line,
uh,uh we have full employment in our operations in china uh we have uh additional shifts introduced in our line feeding,we have full employment in our operations in china production line services spare part services and we see increasing and,

uh,this vtwo or whatever uh let s uh forget it uh but it s not as fast as we thought but,this vtwo or whatever let s forget it but it s not as fast as we thought helps to answer,
uh,fast as we thought but the slump was not as uh severe as we anticipated before but so i hope that,fast as we thought helps to answer your question it s personal cost is the main factor and we are,
uh,means we have gross profit related to that activity and uh the rest is lease cost and uh our idle capacity,means we have a cross profit related to that activity and the rest is lease cost and our idle capacity,
uh,that activity and uh the rest is lease cost and uh our idle capacity has not changed significantly uh we are,related to that activity and the rest is lease cost and our idle capacity has not changed significantly we are,

uh,uh middle of october and in the meantime stay healthy uh don t travel too much uh don t uh forget,and kind of who s losing it and then how much of that market and how much due to actual,
uh,the meantime stay healthy uh don t travel too much uh don t uh forget to use masks because we need,the volumes in america stay at a low and very low level at the moment this is true for both,
uh,healthy uh don t travel too much uh don t uh forget to use masks because we need you as end,time to look at that thank you at the short end to you so see we have cost savings in,
uh,we need you as end consumers like millions and tri uh billions of others because end consumers drive our business model,end to you so see we have cost savings in place and there s no e touch yet because as,

uh,year right you see packaging roughly 10 down you see uh automotive 50 down you see aerospace 40 down right roughly,good morning thanks for taking my question down you see automotive 50 down you see aerospace 40 down right roughly,
uh,is 95 utilization there was a bit of a drop uh especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe uh,is 95 utilization there was a bit of a drop especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe reduction,
uh,uh especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe uh redu reduction in uh canned consumption and all that but,especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe reduction in canned consumption and all that but that has come,
uh,with all the lockdowns in europe uh redu reduction in uh canned consumption and all that but that has come back,with all the lockdowns in europe reduction in canned consumption and all that but that has come back pretty strong,
uh,so we look at you know packaging again recession resilient uh secular growth and we re pretty uh confident for the,america and stable demand in europe evidence that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth we believe the,
uh,again recession resilient uh secular growth and we re pretty uh confident for the second half of the year and we,just wanted if you come in a little bit further on the second half of the year and what the,
uh,kind of an abnormal quarter because of all that happened uh in april and a little bit in may if i,kind of an abnormal quarter because of all that happened in april if i look at automotive it has really,
uh,a little bit in may if i look at automotive uh it has re snapped back i mean i think when,all that happened in april if i look at automotive it has really snapped back i mean i think when,
uh,know it seems like it can be stronger than 80 uh going forward we certainly are running very well in july,it seems like it can be stronger than 80 going forward we still are running very well in july but,

uh,encouraging and hopefully uh you know covid 19 doesn t uh throw too much of a wrench in that uh good,encouraging and hopefully covid 19 doesn t throw too much of a wrench in that good thread we expect more,
uh,t uh throw too much of a wrench in that uh good trend if i look now at aerospace where we,t throw too much of a wrench in that good thread we expect more pain in the second half of,
uh,where we were running at around 60 in the quarter uh we expect more pain in the second half of the,of a wrench in that good thread we expect more pain in the second half of the year and i,
uh,it s a long supply chain um and the customers uh you know move a little bit more slowly in terms,it s a long supply chain and the customers move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their,
uh,know move a little bit more slowly in terms of uh adjusting their orders uh and that that is creating a,and the customers move a little bit more slowly in terms of adjusting their orders and that is creating a,

uh,how how much pain we take we are in very uh detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion,of how much pain we take we are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion,
uh,force on them so what we re working through is uh taking more pain now in the second half so that,force on them so what we re working through is taking more pain now in the second app so that,
uh,expect some reduction in the operating rates in aerospace in uh in the second half of the year so if you,expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the year i would translate all that,
uh,if you translate all that into what it means for uh the different bus i would expect parp packaging and automotive,would translate all that into what it means for the different bu s i would expect bap packaging and automotive,
uh,automotive to be better i would expect as i automotive uh structures essentially to be better in the second half and,automotive to be better i would expect as i automotive structures essentially to be better in the second half and,
uh,impacts yeah i think so so the reason i m uh saying more than 90 or 95 whatever and that s,impacts yeah i think so 90 or 95 or whatever and that s 100 exactly because of some weakness in,
uh,whatever and that s 100 is exactly because of some uh weakness in europe right and i think it s got,or whatever and that s 100 exactly because of some weakness in europe right and i think it s got,
uh,right and i think it s got to do with uh uh both uh you know the the the reduction in,some weakness in europe right and i think it s got to do with both you know the reduction in,
uh,and i think it s got to do with uh uh both uh you know the the the reduction in uh,and i think it s got to do with both you know the reduction in activity in southern europe i,
uh,think it s got to do with uh uh both uh you know the the the reduction in uh activity in,in europe right and i think it s got to do with both you know the reduction in activity in,
uh,uh both uh you know the the the reduction in uh activity in southern europe i mean a lot of these,both you know the reduction in activity in southern europe i mean a lot of these countries have economies that,
uh,southern europe i mean a lot of these countries have uh economies that are based on tourism and you know this,southern europe i mean a lot of these countries have economies that are based on tourism and you know this,
uh,not the best year for tourism as we all know uh and uh we are seeing you know there s little,not the best year for tourism as we all know and we are seeing you know there s little clusters,
uh,best year for tourism as we all know uh and uh we are seeing you know there s little clusters and,best year for tourism as we all know and we are seeing you know there s little clusters and hotspots,
uh,right so that is weighing down a little bit on uh canned consumption in europe yes okay and and just sorry,as it should be a little bit on canton central in europe yes okay and and just sorry i had,
uh,in europe yes okay and and just sorry i had uh one follow up on on uh on on working capital,bit on canton central in europe yes okay and and just sorry i had one follow up on working capital,
uh,just sorry i had uh one follow up on on uh on on working capital specifically i just wanted maybe pe,just sorry i had one follow up on working capital specifically i just wanted maybe peter if you could talk,
uh,um and what the opportunities are that on working capital uh sure in terms of uh you re saying positive for,the year and what the opportunities are that i m working capital in terms of you saying positive for for,
uh,are that on working capital uh sure in terms of uh you re saying positive for the full year you ve,opportunities are that i m working capital in terms of you saying positive for for the full year you ve,
uh,context so um the second quarter as we said last uh quarter we we would uh use working capital and we,very strong cost performance during the second quarter in the second quarter we managed to flex our cost by 83,
uh,quarter as we said last uh quarter we we would uh use working capital and we in fact burned 63 million,just wanted you to talk through the moving parts of working capital sure happy to do it backburned 63 million,
uh,based on where we sit today i think it s uh plausible to think that you know with auto ramping with,based on where we sit today i think it s plausible to think that with auto ramping packaging kind of,
uh,to think that you know with auto ramping with packaging uh kind of continuing to ramp back up uh that that,think it s plausible to think that with auto ramping packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that that,
uh,with packaging uh kind of continuing to ramp back up uh that that we could lose some ground in the in,auto ramping packaging kind of continuing to ramp back up that that we could lose some ground in the in,
uh,in the in the back half of the year so uh not a huge negative but we could see working capital,in the in the back half of the year so not a huge negative but we could but chris i,
uh,a huge negative but we could see working capital being uh used in the back half of the year um but,up that that we could lose some ground in the in the back half of the year so not a,
uh,of the year um but chris i would say that uh we remain confident in spite of that that we uh,huge negative but we could but chris i would say that we remain confident in spite of that that we,
uh,uh we remain confident in spite of that that we uh we can achieve a free cash flow position thanks thanks,say that we remain confident in spite of that that we can achieve a free cash flow position thanks thanks,
uh,a free cash flow position thanks thanks peter that s uh that s it for me thank you okay good your,can achieve a free cash flow position thanks thanks peter that s the tip from me thank you good your,
uh,yeah well i mean we believe it s a misguided uh measure if it happens right we we ve lobbied against,to fruition yeah well i mean we believe it s misguided measure if it happens right we ve lobbied against,
uh,very limited impact on us so i remind you that uh we pass through the metal um cost essentially to uh,i hope this is coming to us in the u s through the u s that s great it s,
uh,uh we pass through the metal um cost essentially to uh most of our customers there may be a little uh,lead into the next question so when you think about your customers we ve had some shutdowns confirmed we have,
uh,uh most of our customers there may be a little uh the section of the business where we cannot reprice immediately,the same rules as we do now that said if it happens it s got a we cannot reprice immediately,
uh,the business where we cannot reprice immediately when it happens uh but on the other side we may gain a little,s got a we cannot reprice immediately when it happens but on the other side we may gain a little,
uh,side we may gain a little bit more on scrap uh recycling as well so not much of an impact for,side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well so not much of an impact for,
uh,as well so not much of an impact for us uh the reason we re against it is much more a,recycling as well so not much of an impact for us the reason we re against it is much more,
uh,free and fair trade than really a problem for our uh finances or our e economic uh outcome got it and,in free and fair trade then really a problem for our finances or our economy i ve got it and,
uh,a problem for our uh finances or our e economic uh outcome got it and then just on on the canned,really a problem for our finances or our economy i ve got it and then just on the canned sheet,
uh,go into the details of exactly which contracts mature when uh but uh you know that we ve got a few,strength yeah so we see a lot of people who are but you know that we ve got a few,
uh,the details of exactly which contracts mature when uh but uh you know that we ve got a few renewals coming,so we see a lot of people who are but you know that we ve got a few renewals coming,
uh,know that we ve got a few renewals coming in uh around the uh 22 horizon uh we are making good,know that we ve got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon your next question comes from the,
uh,ve got a few renewals coming in uh around the uh 22 horizon uh we are making good progress uh and,ve got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon your next question comes from the line of david,
uh,few renewals coming in uh around the uh 22 horizon uh we are making good progress uh and i think the,that we ve got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon your next question comes from the line,
uh,the uh 22 horizon uh we are making good progress uh and i think the pricing environment is uh i would,the u s through the u s that s great it s good to hear john mark and i hope,
uh,good progress uh and i think the pricing environment is uh i would describe it as a mildly positive in the,for the labor benefit benefit i thought it was a covid 19 state aid benefit is that included in the,
uh,that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and uh whilst we you know i say it s mildly positive,of that cost is going to come back right so you know i d say it s hard to give,
uh,and whenever we actually ink a contract things may change uh but i think it s a pretty benign environment and,in the past on the fact that we re in it for the long haul and i think it s,
uh,a pretty benign environment and our product is in demand uh i ll brag a little bit our quality and our,so everybody s a bit you know vigilant as it should be a little bit on canton central in europe,
uh,much recognized muscle shoals has done a terrific job in uh over the past five years uh and is a very,this transaction removed our only near term bond maturity at a very attractive coupon we have taken i am very,
uh,a terrific job in uh over the past five years uh and is a very strong player in the market now,any period in the recent past the second half is always weaker than the first half right in aerospace so,
uh,service wise neuf brisach has always been so we have uh strong positions and i m uh looking at the future,we ll see a stronger rebound and i hope this is coming to us in the u s through the,
uh,been so we have uh strong positions and i m uh looking at the future with a great deal of uh,them and they ll do some things that help us in the future which i ve already done in the,
uh,uh looking at the future with a great deal of uh confidence great thank you that s it thanks thanks josh,us in the future which i ve already done in the past and that s already happened and that s,
uh,million adjusted ebitda line you re talking about for the uh for the labor benefit i thought it was a covid,81 million adjusted ebitda line you re talking about for the labor benefit benefit i thought it was a covid,
uh,substantially less of that i think you should assume that uh in the businesses that it you know it s gonna,to as curps arbite or schommach parsier or short time work in the businesses that you know it s gonna,
uh,packaging for example where we had some benefit in in uh q2 we should have you know basically very limited if,packaging for example where we had some benefit in q2 we should have basically very limited if any benefit in,
uh,limited if if any benefit in in yeah q3 and uh you know automotive which should fade away and and aerospace,q2 we should have basically very limited if any benefit in q3 and automotive which has fade away and aerospace,
uh,give you an indication i we mentioned about people being uh you know unemployed during the quarter at the trough which,lower number to give you an indication we mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter at the trough which,
uh,during the quarter at the trough which is behind us uh we had 6 000 people under some kind of unemployment,mentioned about people being unemployed during the quarter at the trough which is behind us some kind of an employment,
uh,and and david just to put it in perspective the uh you know if you get to the fourth quarter the,dramatically yeah and and dave is just just to put it in perspective if you get to the fourth quarter,
uh,terms of the um you know the the the individual uh and market commentary on the aerospace side obviously that s,in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on a,
uh,terms of the outlook commentary you you you framed obviously uh two segments up one segment down but you know the,terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent,
uh,in the second half or or or a bit more uh you know color on magni order of magnitude on the,and packaging in the second half for a bit more you know color on magnet order of magnitude on the,
uh,would be helpful so it s very difficult to tell uh david because we re as we speak in a very,in aerospace would helpful so it s very difficult to tell david because we re as we speak in very,
uh,contracts whereby we can force them to take some product uh which they will take and pay for all but then,contracts whereby we can force them to take some product which they will take and pay for all but then,
uh,the way i don t think they fully know now uh and it s no criticism of them i mean it,by the way i don t think they fully know now and it s no criticism of them i mean,
uh,say that there will be for sure more pain in uh in uh other structures and then the you know those,i could answer your question possibly at this stage i cannot more pain in auto structures and then in auto,
uh,there will be for sure more pain in uh in uh other structures and then the you know those structures in,answer your question possibly at this stage i cannot more pain in auto structures and then in auto structures in,
uh,inaudible facilities is that right what is that number now uh we re running still around that number but i would,your facilities is that right what is that number now we re running still around that number but i would,
uh,still around that number but i would expect it to uh go down maybe to 50 that kind of range okay,still around that number but i would expect it to go down maybe to 50 percent that kind of range,
uh,s helpful thanks very much okay yeah it s very uh it s important to say we re not expecting it,s helpful thanks very much okay your next question comes from the line of kurt woodward from credit suisse good,
uh,down to 30 right even that s that s not uh not on the horizon your next question comes from the,know that we ve got a few renewals coming in around the 22 horizon your next question comes from the,
uh,is open yeah hi good morning hi curt hi curt uh peter first question on on the 100 million of cost,from the line of kurt woodward from credit suisse good morning peter first question on the 100 million euro cost,
uh,so um if we look if we look at the uh i mean so the biggest piece of that hundred million,two companies so we re looking past the current crisis the current crisis we ve got to get all in,
uh,i mean so the biggest piece of that hundred million uh is related to labor right so x and that s,do expect some of that cost is going to come back right so you know i d say it s,
uh,s probably you know half of that hundred million so uh what we re doing now is we are really closely,being built right so that s what we re trying to do whether we get there fully i don t,
uh,trying to size our labor forces according to that so uh in that regard i think we would expect that there,i automotive structures essentially to be better in the second half and it would expect the nt to be more,
uh,we would expect that there s going to be some uh kind of permanent savings but remember as we uh kind,take out of the business this year on a permanent basis kind of permanent savings but remember as we kind,
uh,some uh kind of permanent savings but remember as we uh kind of ramp up the operations uh we do expect,a permanent basis kind of permanent savings but remember as we kind of ramp up the operations we do expect,
uh,remember as we uh kind of ramp up the operations uh we do expect some of that cost is gonna come,savings but remember as we kind of ramp up the operations we do expect some of that cost is going,
uh,a really precise number o on that curt it s uh it s a difficult one yeah okay um kurt if,a really precise number on that kurt it s a difficult one kurt if i may add we have talked,
uh,difficult one yeah okay um kurt if i may add uh we have talked about horizon 22 right and one of,difficult one kurt if i may add we have talked about horizon 22 right and one of the strategic initially,
uh,and i think what covid 19 is doing to us uh and i guess to many other companies out there is,stronger and i think what covid 19 is doing to us and i guess to many other companies out there,
uh,to be implemented so along the lines that peter was uh saying i think we ll come out of this with,to be implemented so along the lines that peter was saying i think we ll come out of this with,
uh,not ramp up and inject back 100 million of costs uh how much you know wi will remain to be seen,good morning peter first question on the 100 million euro cost reductions how much of that would you view as,
uh,wi will remain to be seen because we re really uh learning as we re doing and we re just in,when we talked on q1 we re talking of 20 utilization as we were speaking and now we re at,
uh,we re just in the middle of it now but uh we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger,i think we ll come out of this with some permanent out of that leaner and stronger and there s,
uh,know kind of big categories of reduction i think we uh were able to uh to kind of live without a,those are you know kind of big categories of reduction i think we were able to kind of live without,
uh,categories of reduction i think we uh were able to uh to kind of live without a lot of that going,categories of reduction i think we were able to kind of live without a lot of that going forward so,

uh,and curt you know as we go forward we ll uh we may be able to give you more color on,remotely with more of an impact as we go forward we may be able to give you more color on,
uh,at taking structural costs out and in the short term uh the objective is we wanna be you know kind of,at taking structural costs out we want to emerge with a much stronger earnings power and packaging over 80 and,
uh,power so we re focused on exactly that and and uh you know we ll have more to say as as,sort of non recourse to you well again it is recourse to us exactly that and it obviously was an,
uh,dynamics you mentioned i think a 73 million impact from uh factoring this quarter or otherwise you d be free cash,no fair question so i think i ve commented in the past on the fact that i thought that the,
uh,we won t put a specific number on it but uh we re confident that we will generate free cash flow,so we won t put a specific number on it but we re confident and the back half of the,
uh,comment on i guess working with the oems to create uh you said a clean slate entering 202 so you know,4 so i guess what i m asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon you know,
uh,what you meant by the clean slate comment well yeah uh no fair question so um i think i ve commented,actual bill to rate to help them clear inventory well yeah no fair question so i think i ve commented,
uh,i thought that the shipments we re making into the uh to the oems right into the supply chain were actually,the fact that i thought that the shipments were making to the oen right into the supply chain were actually,
uh,half i think is not going to cure all the uh you know uh inventory build up in the supply chain,the build rates were warranting at the time sure all the you know inventory build up in the supply chain,
uh,is not going to cure all the uh you know uh inventory build up in the supply chain first of all,were warranting at the time sure all the you know inventory build up in the supply chain first of all,
uh,inventory build up in the supply chain first of all uh but i think what that does is it positions us,inventory build up in the supply chain first of all but i think what that does is it positions us,
uh,in 21 than what the second the nine months of uh you know post covid uh will be in uh a,1 million euros higher than last year in the first six months of 2020 constellium achieved 228 million euros of,
uh,second the nine months of uh you know post covid uh will be in uh a t that s that s,second quarter was around 60 at your facilities is that right what is that number now we re running still,
uh,of uh you know post covid uh will be in uh a t that s that s one of the goals,but certainly we are aiming to be better in 21 will be in anp that s one of the goals,
uh,goals um in terms of what we re getting from uh the oems uh we ve got very strong deep strategic,goals in terms of what we re getting from the oems you ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with,
uh,terms of what we re getting from uh the oems uh we ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with them,in terms of what we re getting from the oems you ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with them,
uh,we ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with them uh i ve commented also in the past from the fact,ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with them i ve commented also in the past on the fact that,
uh,it for the long haul and i think it s uh evidenced by the 10 year contract we ve signed with,it for the long haul and i think it s evidenced by the 10 year contract we signed with airbus,
uh,10 year contract we ve signed with airbus i mean uh 10 year is a long duration never happened before and,10 year contract we signed with airbus i mean 10 year is a long duration never happened before the desire,
uh,10 year is a long duration never happened before and uh we did it uh because it was the right thing,10 year is a long duration never happened before the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies,
uh,long duration never happened before and uh we did it uh because it was the right thing to do for both,long duration never happened before the desire to cement the strategic alignment between the two companies so we re looking,
uh,because it was the right thing to do for both uh companies for both businesses and we didn t do it,because of some weakness in europe right and i think it s got to do with both you know the,
uh,in the same boat or in the same aircraft and uh put us in the same place work together to overcome,in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place work together to overcome,
uh,be in the win win partnership and we do some uh things that help them and they ll do some things,be in a win win partnership and we do some things that help them and they ll do some things,
uh,have already done in the past and that s already uh that s already happened and that s continuing okay great,future which i ve already done in the past and that s already happened and that s continuing okay great,
uh,volumes were down about 11 but um you know norsk uh reported canned volumes up 11 i think you guys face,were down about 11 percent but you know norsk reported can volumes up 11 percent i think you guys face,
uh,mainly i believe i mean i cannot comment on their uh specific uh situation but in in our case the main,won t put a specific number on it but we re confident and the back half of the year i,
uh,believe i mean i cannot comment on their uh specific uh situation but in in our case the main reason was,specific number on it but we re confident and the back half of the year i think there s a,
uh,at the center of a hot spot of the first uh real hot spot in france uh and that was a,at the center of a hotspot the first real hotspot in france and that was the finished goods and that,
uh,spot of the first uh real hot spot in france uh and that was a very uh very terrible conditions for,that naplizak was at the center of a hotspot the first real hotspot in france and that was the finished,
uh,hot spot in france uh and that was a very uh very terrible conditions for uh you know second half of,hotspot in france and that was the finished goods and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter,
uh,and that was a very uh very terrible conditions for uh you know second half of march so in march we,pain we take we are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at,
uh,of finnish goods but then we had to replenish the uh the the finnish goods and that really took down our,a hotspot the first real hotspot in france and that was the finished goods and that really took down our,
uh,the the finnish goods and that really took down our uh you know our shipments in the second quarter but we,france and that was the finished goods and that really took down our shipments in the second quarter but we,
uh,but we re back to normal now okay that s uh that s sort of what i expected um and on,second quarter but we re back to normal now okay thanks that s sort of what i expected and on,
uh,extent is it guaranteed by the french government well it uh depends on the facility but the big one the french,extent is it guaranteed by the french government well it depends on the facility but the big one the french,
uh,the big one the french one is secured on on uh uh pp e um and uh in the case of,facility but the big one the french one is secured on a ppe and e and in the case of,
uh,big one the french one is secured on on uh uh pp e um and uh in the case of the,but the big one the french one is secured on a ppe and e and in the case of the,

uh,state in the case of germany i think it s uh 80 too so just just for for our purposes as,guaranteed by the french state in the case of germany i think it s 80 too for our purposes as,
uh,sort of non recourse to you well again it s uh it is it is recourse to us uh what i,sort of non recourse to you well again it is recourse to us exactly that and it obviously was an,
uh,it s uh it is it is recourse to us uh what i think t t the point is is that,to you well again it is recourse to us exactly that and it obviously was an inducement for the banks,
uh,if you re in the syndicate of banks and you uh are lending say 50 your responsibility is for 10 oh,syndicate of banks with in the case of france i think the guarantee is for 70 percent of the or,
uh,it just sits on our balance sheet as cash and uh the german facility that we ve now signed up in,active discussions with our customers and at the end of the day it s a call that we have to,
uh,july you know we don t expect to draw that uh the dd uh the delay draw term loan we haven,but yeah you re right we don t have a strong incentive to repay that but what we will do,
uh,we don t expect to draw that uh the dd uh the delay draw term loan we haven t drawn that,good thread we expect more pain in the second half of the year and i think the reason for that,
uh,the delay draw term loan we haven t drawn that uh and the swiss facility uh we don t have that,no no that s right on the use of the capital right so for example we can t use that,
uh,we haven t drawn that uh and the swiss facility uh we don t have that drawn in in most instances,in the past on the fact that we re in it for the long haul and i think it s,
uh,the way we benefit from the state guarantee is through uh very cheap interest rates yeah that s right right so,in the past on the fact that i thought that the shipments were making to the oen right into the,
uh,so we re not gonna to pay a lot of uh interest for it yeah exactly that and it obviously was,is sort of non recourse to you well again it is recourse to us exactly that and it obviously was,
uh,banks to lend right now fair enough and that s uh you know i think the french facility is what 2,banks to lend right now fair enough and that s you know i think the french facility is what two,
uh,given your your bonds are kind of twice that right uh no no that s right now remember the the uh,know given your bonds or kind of twice that right no no that s right on the use of the,
uh,uh no no that s right now remember the the uh the use of the cap there are some limitations on,your bonds or kind of twice that right no no that s right on the use of the capital right,
uh,example we can t use that capital to go and uh buy back bonds in the market so it s really,example we can t use that capital to go and buy back bonds in the market it s really meant,
uh,the market so it s really meant to be for uh you know kind of operating needs of a company but,buy back bonds in the market it s really meant to be for operating needs of a company but yeah,

uh,s been pretty strong as we ve used prices really uh you know rising even above last year um you know,been pretty strong as a way to use prices really rising even above last year we talk about how production,
uh,it s above the 80 that i m mentioning right uh but we ve been a little bit caught uh you,it s above the 80 that i m mentioning right customers just a few months ago telling us we need,
uh,right uh but we ve been a little bit caught uh you know by customers uh just a few months ago,there s no question it s above the 80 that i m mentioning right customers just a few months ago,

uh,both continents and that is you know pretty good for uh end demand at the end of the day so i,with our customers and at the end of the day it s a call that we have to make it,
uh,of the day so i hope it s gonna be uh it s gonna materialize into and the older book we,half of the year and i think the reason for that is it s a long supply chain and the,
uh,orders and shipments in which case it could be better uh but you know i ve uh we we we we,our shipments in the second quarter but we re back to normal now okay thanks that s sort of what,
uh,it could be better uh but you know i ve uh we we we we ve seen fits and starts you,of money in the hands of consumers right through the unemployment benefits of you know different fits and starts you,
uh,we we we ve seen fits and starts you see uh plants restarting and then uh shutting down because uh there,the unemployment benefits of you know different fits and starts you see plants restarting and then shutting down because there,
uh,fits and starts you see uh plants restarting and then uh shutting down because uh there s uh covid infections or,you know different fits and starts you see plants restarting and then shutting down because there s covid infections or,
uh,see uh plants restarting and then uh shutting down because uh there s uh covid infections or you see people having,and starts you see plants restarting and then shutting down because there s covid infections or you see people having,
uh,restarting and then uh shutting down because uh there s uh covid infections or you see people having uh trouble uh,restarting and then shutting down because there s covid infections or you see people having trouble staffing you know the,
uh,there s uh covid infections or you see people having uh trouble uh stashing you know the full shift because there,down because there s covid infections or you see people having trouble staffing you know the false shift because there,
uh,uh covid infections or you see people having uh trouble uh stashing you know the full shift because there s uh,s covid infections or you see people having trouble staffing you know the false shift because there s too many,
uh,uh stashing you know the full shift because there s uh uh too many cases in the in the hot spots,you see people having trouble staffing you know the false shift because there s too many cases in the hotspot,
uh,stashing you know the full shift because there s uh uh too many cases in the in the hot spots so,see people having trouble staffing you know the false shift because there s too many cases in the hotspot so,
uh,i i it s still fragile i mean it looks uh quite good but it s still fragile right that s,so it s still fragile i mean and it looks quite good but it s still fragile right that s,
uh,i would think so i think all of us have uh made uh tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper,i hope this is coming to us in the u s through the u s that s great it s,
uh,think so i think all of us have uh made uh tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper environment from,this is coming to us in the u s through the u s that s great it s good to,
uh,i think all of us have uh made uh tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper environment from uh for,i think you guys face relatively the same markets in europe can you sort of point to why maybe they,
uh,of us have uh made uh tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper environment from uh for our uh employees,to us in the u s through the u s that s great it s good to hear john mark,
uh,tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper environment from uh for our uh employees uh it s very interesting i,to remove yourself from the queue we ve pressed the pound key your first question comes from the line of,
uh,to uh provide the proper environment from uh for our uh employees uh it s very interesting i i was commenting,slide presentation would supplement our ifrs disclosures good morning good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in constellion,
uh,provide the proper environment from uh for our uh employees uh it s very interesting i i was commenting on the,getting from the oems you ve got very strong deep strategic relationships with them i ve commented also in the,
uh,percent of our e employees have been affected by covid uh confirmed um we have had no new case confirmed case,when you think about your customers we ve had some shutdowns confirmed we have had no new case confirmed case,
uh,saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility uh in their daily lives right because it goes beyond what,in the past on the fact that we re in it for the long haul and i think it s,
uh,hours or 10 hours whatever that they work with us uh you can have an impact and i think you know,s the code all right so you don t really have an incentive to pay that off quickly you know,
uh,you know if people wear masks when they interact with uh outside uh which people uh they they come across i,you know norsk reported can volumes up 11 percent i think you guys face relatively the same markets in europe,
uh,if people wear masks when they interact with uh outside uh which people uh they they come across i think it,with them in terms of what is it exactly they need which by the way i don t think they,
uh,masks when they interact with uh outside uh which people uh they they come across i think it makes a tremendous,in the past we ve got it removed it may come back we think it s misguided and it doesn,
uh,they come across i think it makes a tremendous difference uh so i hope the reality will slowly or more more,the year i would translate all that into what it means for the different bu s i would expect bap,
uh,hope the reality will slowly or more more than slowly uh settle in and uh and good practices will uh get,no new case confirmed case in europe since the middle of may in and at good practice it will get,
uh,slowly or more more than slowly uh settle in and uh and good practices will uh get that uh virus a,in europe since the middle of may in and at good practice it will get that virus away from us,
uh,slowly uh settle in and uh and good practices will uh get that uh virus a away from us uh sooner,europe since the middle of may in and at good practice it will get that virus away from us sooner,
uh,in and uh and good practices will uh get that uh virus a away from us uh sooner rather than later,middle of may in and at good practice it will get that virus away from us sooner rather than later,
uh,will uh get that uh virus a away from us uh sooner rather than later and i think got you people,will get that virus away from us sooner rather than later you need to be affected to take steps and,

uh,is is that is that what you re getting at uh it is yeah it it is i guess uh you,is in excess of lost track basis expanding margins is that what you re getting at it is i guess,
uh,at uh it is yeah it it is i guess uh you you know on business interruption you had 20 basis,expanding margins is that what you re getting at it is i guess in business interruption you had 20 basic,
uh,written and earned basis rate is ahead of loss trend uh we ve had improved performances in some business you got,change was 1 5 percent as we continue to moderate pricing given the improved performance in our book over the,
uh,some impact of covid it was modest but not zero uh you know you ve got the year over year uh,some impact of covid it was modest but not zero you know you ve got the year over year that,
uh,uh you know you ve got the year over year uh in that sort of ongoing carry on impact of of,you know you ve got the year over year that sort of ongoing carry on impact of social inflation that,
uh,lines in cmp but as i said in my remarks uh relatively modest compared to compared to those reserve bases hmm,s been possibly some relatively modest compared to compared to those reserve basis okay thank you dan your next question,
uh,feel for just you know forget about the net benefit uh from the covid just from the direct loss of the,feel for just you know forget about the net benefit from the covid just from the direct losses alone or,
uh,the loan um or the direct impact what was the uh the hit that that had in business interruption on the,the direct losses alone or the direct impact what was the hit that that had in business interruption on the,
uh,of of directly related charges and while that included some uh some charges for the management liability coverages in bond and,pluses and the minuses related charges and while that included some charges for the management liability coverages in bond and,
uh,pre announcement you said it was mostly short tail lines uh so should we take that to mean i mean first,pre announcement you said it was mostly short tailed lines so should we take that to me i mean first,
uh,you re being conservative and waiting to see if that uh continues to be the case yeah ryan dan again so,you re being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be the case yeah ryan dan again but,
uh,some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect uh in in this current environment and when we look at,some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in this current environment too much favorability to simply say,
uh,relative to middle market that s really a product mix uh dynamic in the select business we have the thrust of,at relative to middle market that s really a product mix dynamic in the select business we have the thrust,
uh,gl and so you know we re continuing to see uh pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there,gl and so you know we re continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there,
uh,gl product is is more on a standalone rated basis uh and then the retention overall uh for select you know,exposure on select that you do on the middle market where basis and then the retention overall for select we,
uh,a standalone rated basis uh and then the retention overall uh for select you know we we certainly put our our,middle market where basis and then the retention overall for select we certainly put our estimate of what we see,
uh,our our estimate of what we see in terms of uh you know business uh insolvencies bankruptcies and that s all,we certainly put our estimate of what we see in terms of your business insolvencies bankruptcies and that s all,
uh,what we see in terms of uh you know business uh insolvencies bankruptcies and that s all inside the 82 number,estimate of what we see in terms of your business insolvencies bankruptcies and that s all inside the 82 number,
uh,the line of meyer shields with kbw please go ahead uh great thanks greg if i heard you correctly in your,you your next question comes along with mayor schilz with kbw please go ahead great thanks sir mayor we look,
uh,the full portfolio and that s obviously a headline number uh what we did this quarter is we looked at you,the full portfolio and that s obviously a headline number what we did this quarter as we looked at you,
uh,of us we also look at some of the social uh inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about uh,front of us we also look at some of the social inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about,
uh,uh inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about uh when we roll that all up in aggregate we we,also look at some of the social inflation or liability dynamics that dan just talked about up in aggregate we,
uh,the question again i m i m trying to understand uh i know that in general workers compensation pricing has been,while retention was strong at 82 the headwind for workers compensation pricing is most pronounced in the select business new,
uh,has been coming down because industry experience has been good uh but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant um,you experience this thing good but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant exposure unit headwind and i m,
uh,majority of your covid losses thus ignoring the favorable impact uh in the second quarter just specifically within business insurance yeah,your covid loss is that s ignoring the favorable impact in the second quarter just specifically within business insurance yeah,
uh,for sure is workers comp um some some property losses uh both domestically and internationally uh and then dribs and drabs,the largest line for sure is workers cop some property losses both domestically and internationally and then dribs and drabs,
uh,um some some property losses uh both domestically and internationally uh and then dribs and drabs i would say in other,is workers cop some property losses both domestically and internationally and then dribs and drabs i would say and other,
uh,know i i appreciate the comments um that you made uh just before the q a but i guess i m,guess i appreciate the comments that you made just before the q a q a but i guess i m,
uh,covid related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year uh you know just looking through your portfolio of exposures and,sense of how you re thinking throughout the rest of the year just looking through your portfolio of exposures and,
uh,uncertainties for the economy that have the biggest impact on uh of of the pandemic on on us um but i,s probably the uncertainties for the economy that have the the biggest impact of the pandemic on us but i,
uh,our net charges were about 15 million bucks putting aside uh the investment side and and and we ve you know,were net charges were about 50 million bucks putting aside the investment side and we ve you know put up,
uh,the year okay great that that s helpful appreciate that uh alan and then just just one more so excluding workers,the first half of the year i hope we ll appreciate that and then just one more so excluding workers,
uh,sort of how that compares versus the last few quarters uh and and and also you know sorta thinking about and,sort of how that compares versus the last few quarters you had mentioned you know you re looking at lost,
uh,you know sorta thinking about and i i think dan uh you had mentioned you know you re looking at loss,the last few quarters you had mentioned you know you re looking at lost trend of 5 now and what,
uh,re taking it up about about a half a point uh in the current quarter but you gotta look at that,it up about a half a point in the current quarter but you ve got to look at that in,
uh,look at that in in relation to the pricing momentum uh as well and i think greg could correct me if,ve got to look at that in relation to the pricing momentum as well i think greg could correct me,
uh,more in on the the adverse development in general liability uh hoping to get a little bit more color in terms,in on the adverse development in general liability i m hoping to get a little bit more color in terms,
uh,color in terms of what you saw in the quarter uh that i guess brought you to make that change because,color in terms of what you saw in the quarter that or was it more just a view of you,
uh,line of paul newsome with piper sandler please go ahead uh you you ve hit the big ones for me but,question comes from one of paul newsome with piper sandler go ahead you ve hit the big ones for me,
uh,you you ve hit the big ones for me but uh one just quick one um from an investment perspective uh,sandler go ahead you ve hit the big ones for me but one just quick one from an investment perspective,

uh,taken place certainly not to the levels of personal insurance uh and and just as a reminder in in commercial auto,home has taken place certainly not to the levels of personal insurance and just as a reminder in commercial auto,
uh,in commercial auto it s a little unique and personal uh where we do have lay up credits or premium credits,in commercial auto it s a little unique and personal where we do have lay up credits or you know,
uh,we don t have further refunds planned in personal auto uh you know i think i think like many we re,we don t have further refunds planned in personal auto you know i think like many more traditional mechanisms like,
uh,time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings uh to make sure that rate s in line with loss,think like many more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that the refund is really an acute issue,
uh,activity around it and and even some litigation around it uh as as we ve noted we ve got um provisions,some claim activity around it and even some litigation around it as we ve noted we ve got but provisions,
uh,and so we don t expect many of those claims uh a actually to pay up it s dan one one,s dan one related comment to that even where we don t expect ultimately to pay the indemnity on the,
uh,most uncertainty in terms of claims given what happens on uh sort of in terms of litigation activity or are there,most uncertainty in terms of claims given what happens in terms of litigation activity or are there other lines where,

uh,go ahead with your question hey and morning this is uh actually richie here for julien uh i just had a,america please go ahead with your question hey and morning this is actually richie here for julian just had a,
uh,and morning this is uh actually richie here for julien uh i just had a question around the the cafex rates,your question hey and morning this is actually richie here for julian just had a question around the capex rays,
uh,a question around the the cafex rates and ftl and uh gulf what what was driving that is that more around,a question around the capex rays at ftl and gulf what was driving that is that more around undergrounding grid,
uh,the solar side and how should we think about the uh cafex traj trajectory from 21 and beyond is that more,the solar side and how should we think about the cat back trajectory from 21 and beyond is that more,
uh,and thanks for the question i think it really reflects uh of you know consistency with what we ve we ve,and thanks for the question i think it really reflects consistency with what we ve been talking about for a,
uh,a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects uh for our customers and investment opportunities um and we re,a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects for our customers and investment opportunities and we re starting,
uh,we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate uh between 2018 and 2022 of a 9 compound annual growth,do have a consistent expectations for the the growth rate between 2018 and 2022 of a 9 compound annual growth,
uh,and under grounding is highlighted by the storm protection plan uh that we re in the process of uh of going,around undergrounding grid hardening or is that more on the solar side and how should we think about the cat,
uh,protection plan uh that we re in the process of uh of going through approvals and and um and you know,i think in terms of sandy cooper that process has been pushed to next year and we remain you know,
uh,through approvals and and um and you know initial investments uh for that program so we re super excited about the,near term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program we are excited about the,
uh,opportunities for investing and again stay very focused on ensuring uh that these are good projects for the benefit of our,opportunities for investment across the board and of course at fpl and gulf that s focused on investments that you,
uh,your comments around hydrogen i i think you ve disclosed uh 65 million for that pilot project um what what are,your comments around hydrogen i think he disclosed 65 million for that pilot project is this more around transportation opportunities,
uh,seeing there on on that front is this more around uh transportation opportunities or is this um around like uh pipeline,disclosed 65 million for that pilot project is this more around transportation opportunities or is this all around like pipeline,
uh,around uh transportation opportunities or is this um around like uh pipeline and and being able to like blend with the,around transportation opportunities or is this all around like pipeline and being able to blend with pipes we re really,
uh,thought about what it would take to get to true uh zero emissions we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive,thought about what it we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers what makes us really excited about,
uh,zero emissions we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive uh for customers what makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly,it we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive for customers what makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in,
uh,technologies and we ll see what other opportunities there are uh potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors um you know,the technologies and we ll see what other opportunities supply chain and get better equipped to deal you know take,
uh,us to be able to pro you know produce that uh the green energy to produce the green hydrogen uh is,be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long term potential of hydrogen produce 100 green hydrogen through a,
uh,that uh the green energy to produce the green hydrogen uh is a potential signif significant opportunity for us we think,the hydrogen i m wondering if you see a potential path for this to be an opportunity at near and,
uh,with it obviously do a lot of research um and uh talk to folks in the supply chain and and get,part of that we ll learn about the technologies and we ll see what other opportunities supply chain and get,
uh,the supply chain and and get better equipped to deal uh you know take advantage of these opportunities but were really,opportunities supply chain and get better equipped to deal you know take advantage of these opportunities but we re really,
uh,year just some thoughts around that thanks cub we appreciate uh you dialing in this morning um we re really excited,near just some thoughts around that thanks constance we appreciate you dialing in this morning pursuing opportunities for investment across,
uh,the ability to recycle capital to third parties as well uh so there s plenty of ways to ensure that we,the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over time so there s you know we,
uh,there s plenty of ways to ensure that we can uh create the real you know value of creative opportunities um,resources that we can create the real value of creative opportunities and still think about it from a corporate perspective,
uh,perspective in a variety of different ways thanks that s uh no that s very helpful and uh kind of pivoting,it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways thanks that s very helpful and kind of pivoting,
uh,thanks that s uh no that s very helpful and uh kind of pivoting a little bit to to something a,a variety of different ways thanks that s very helpful and kind of pivoting a little bit to something a,
uh,to to something a little bit longer term i guess uh can you tell me your thoughts on the november election,to something a little bit longer term i guess can we get some of your thoughts on the november election,
uh,know we i think if you can remember back three uh you know close to four years ago now there was,know i think it s early and there s clearly an opportunity to you know five to ten years from,
uh,years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock uh when president trump was elected uh we ve uh managed,our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections when president trump was elected we ve managed,
uh,turmoil around our stock uh when president trump was elected uh we ve uh managed completely fine under this administration in,regardless of the outcome of elections when president trump was elected we ve managed completely fine under this administration in,
uh,stock uh when president trump was elected uh we ve uh managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being,outcome of elections when president trump was elected we ve managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being,
uh,so you know obviously we watch them closely we think uh good clean energy policies important and the right policy for,you know obviously we watch them closely we think good clean energy policy is important and the right policy for,
uh,right policy for for for america and the future and uh you know we continue i think to be positioned uh,energy policy is important and the right policy for america in the future and you know we continue i think,
uh,uh you know we continue i think to be positioned uh really well regardless of who wins in november okay that,and you know we continue i think okay that makes sense i ll jump back in the queue thanks so,
uh,in november okay that makes sense i ll i ll uh tell that to inaudible thanks so much inaudible thank you,i think okay that makes sense i ll jump back in the queue thanks so much congrats thank you here,
uh,what do you think might actually occur in the next uh four years yeah you know so i think its honestly,different alternatives what do you think might actually occur in the next four years so i think it s honestly,
uh,four years yeah you know so i think its honestly uh too soon to tell michael i think uh you know,four years so i think it s honestly too soon to tell michael i think a lot is going to,
uh,its honestly uh too soon to tell michael i think uh you know a lot is going to depend on what,honestly too soon to tell michael i think a lot is going to depend on what happens in the election,
uh,a continued split government or is there not split government uh that ll be i think a big driver of what,and is there continued split government or is there not split government and what we ve said which is that,
uh,i think a big driver of what policies happen and uh you know i think uh all of those ideas are,at all of that and we re not you know we re not being all of that in the end,
uh,of what policies happen and uh you know i think uh all of those ideas are on the table we we,at all of that and we re not you know we re not being all of that in the end,
uh,in in in what we ve said which is that uh uh you know we think it s important to have,not split government and what we ve said which is that you know we think it s important to have,
uh,in in what we ve said which is that uh uh you know we think it s important to have uh,not split government and what we ve said which is that you know we think it s important to have,
uh,uh you know we think it s important to have uh you know good and fair clean energy policy going forward,which is that you know we think it s important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward,
uh,you know good and fair clean energy policy going forward uh we also have said that it s uh that we,important to have good and fair clean energy policy going forward we also have said that it s that we,
uh,going forward uh we also have said that it s uh that we think wind and and renewables with batteries will,energy policy going forward we also have said that it s that we think wind and renewables with batteries will,
uh,we think wind and and renewables with batteries will be uh you know are very competitive uh you know once the,we think wind and renewables with batteries will be you know once the ptcs and the itcs phase out in,
uh,with batteries will be uh you know are very competitive uh you know once the ptc s and the rtc s,it s that we think wind and renewables with batteries will be you know once the ptcs and the itcs,
uh,s and the rtc s phase out in terms of uh competing against conventional generation it s just honestly uh really,know once the ptcs and the itcs phase out in terms of competing against conventional generation it s honestly really,
uh,of uh competing against conventional generation it s just honestly uh really more a matter of the speed with which you,competing against conventional generation it s honestly really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize,
uh,to decarbonize is what i gonna ultimately drive the final uh i think policy choices and so uh you know we,to decarbonize is what is going to ultimately drive the final i think policy choices in your future construction plans,
uh,drive the final uh i think policy choices and so uh you know we re you know obviously we re actively,drive the final i think policy choices in your future construction plans at fdl i m just wondering if hydrogen,
uh,obviously we re actively engaged in in the discussions and uh uh i think it s premature really to say what,obviously we have access to very efficient capital we know how to operate equipment and so a lot of that,
uh,we re actively engaged in in the discussions and uh uh i think it s premature really to say what we,levels going forward richie good morning and thanks for the question i think it really reflects consistency with what we,
uh,think it s premature really to say what we think uh is gonna happen cause i think you have an election,think it s honestly too soon to tell michael i think a lot is going to depend on what happens,
uh,and as as you all know elections have consequences and uh and you know we ll we ll we ll see,now and that kind of transcends politics frankly the economics and the need to you know and really the need,
uh,post the election in terms of what s gonna be uh uh the policy when inaudible going for great hey um,you have been the industry leader in terms of cost management do you think the pace of change in o,
uh,the election in terms of what s gonna be uh uh the policy when inaudible going for great hey um on,to look i think in terms of sandy cooper that process has been pushed to next year and we remain,
uh,future construction plans at fpl i m just wondering if uh if hydrogen works out is that a message do you,choices in your future construction plans at fdl i m just wondering if hydrogen works out is that a method,
uh,a message do you think you could actually build more uh put more gas turbines back into the plan if if,a method do you think you could actually build more put more gas turbines back into the plan if hydrogen,
uh,plan if if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative uh or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited,the plan if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited,
uh,mike i think um you know from a hydrogen perspective uh and specific to florida power and light company we re,mike i think from a hydrogen perspective and specific to florida power and light company we re talking about potential,
uh,the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions uh profile uh we would uh retrofit certain of our you,the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to,
uh,alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions uh profile uh we would uh retrofit certain of our you know gas,alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run on,
uh,getting to a zero emissions uh profile uh we would uh retrofit certain of our you know gas facilities to run,best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions profile we would retrofit certain of our gas facilities to run,
uh,we re talking about a long way into the future uh you wouldn t necessarily need to build any new you,we re talking about a long way down the road and a lot of things need to come together to,
uh,in that portfolio cause we ve got a tremendously efficient uh fleet that s already in services on the investments we,in that portfolio because we ve got a tremendously efficient fleet that s already in service and the investments we,
uh,s fairly preliminary gotcha and you know one final question uh this may you re coming on m a interest these,road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations m a interest these,
uh,on with sandy cooper et cetera so i think we uh this won t be surprising we remain interested in m,going on with santee cooper et cetera so i think we this won t be surprising we remain interested in,
uh,won t be surprising we remain interested in m a uh we think there s a lot that we can bring,won t be surprising we remain interested in m a we think there s a lot that we can bring,
uh,a utility in the country that we couldn t run uh more efficiently and uh uh better for customers and i,a utility in the country that we couldn t run more efficiently and better for customers and i truly believe,

uh,much jim crosstalk plus for regulated assets pretty much anywhere uh perfect okay thanks a lot thank you our next question,thank you very much plus ferc regulated assets pretty much anywhere okay thanks a lot thank you our next question,
uh,steve inaudible on for steven thanks for taking my question uh i have one quick followup just on the hydrogen topic,steven for stephen thanks for taking my question i had one quick follow up just on the hydrogen i m,
uh,you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function uh within in the supply chain um and if so so,of kind of business model involved in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain and if so do you,
uh,you have a kind of a vision or views on uh what technology is ahead of others at this point thanks,you have kind of a vision or view on what technology is ahead of others at this point thanks dave,
uh,other pilot types of investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio uh consistent with the way that we approach sol solar early,for our customers and investment opportunities and we re starting to put those in place as i highlighted in the,
uh,recently so i think there will be opportunities over time uh for those type of pilot projects you know again where,point we re looking for opportunities across the portfolio opportunities over time for those type of pilot projects again where,
uh,business but historically um as you know we ve not uh played in the space of owning uh you know being,business but historically as you know we ve not played in the space of owning you know being a vertically,
uh,we ve not uh played in the space of owning uh you know being a vertically integrated uh you know owner,historically as you know we ve not played in the space of owning you know being a vertically integrated owner,
uh,space of owning uh you know being a vertically integrated uh you know owner of technologies or or projects uh we,space of owning you know being a vertically integrated owner of technologies or projects you know apply our scale and,
uh,integrated uh you know owner of technologies or or projects uh we typically um take in the best of um manufactured,integrated owner of technologies or projects you know apply our scale and our ability to construct own an operate over,
uh,at this point i wouldn t think that we would uh focus on vertically integrating it s more of um you,at this point i wouldn t think that we would focus on vertically integrating integrating it s more of applying,
uh,a as a technology consistent the way that we ve uh created value in the past so so the only i,of applying hydrogen as a technology consistent the way that we ve created value in the past so the only,
uh,that two things one is i would be disappointed if uh in john s business we don t make some kind,that two things one is i d be disappointed if in john s business we don t make some kind,
uh,make some kind of pilot investment in the next year uh were looking at a variety of things and i d,t make some kind of pilot investment in the next year we re looking at a variety of things and,
uh,did a decade ago in the battery storage business secondly uh you know clearly were not gonna backward integrate into manufacturing,a decade ago in the battery storage business secondly clearly we re not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzes,
uh,you know clearly were not gonna backward integrate into manufacturing uh electrolizers or anything like that but uh i wouldn t,clearly we re not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzes or anything like that but i wouldn t rule,
uh,integrate into manufacturing uh electrolizers or anything like that but uh i wouldn t i wouldn t rule out us owning,not going to backward integrate into manufacturing electrolyzes or anything like that but i wouldn t rule out us owning,
uh,t rule out us owning them as part of a uh integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen,t rule out us owning them as part of a integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacture hydrogen,
uh,long term contract and obviously we have access to very uh efficient capital we know how to operate equipment um we,a long term contract and obviously we have access to very efficient capital we know how to operate equipment and,
uh,we re we are there s clearly an opportunity to uh you know five to you know five to ten years,early and there s clearly an opportunity to you know five to ten years from now to displace or and,
uh,to make renewables to displace diesel fuel and perhaps even uh other types of transportation fuel going forward and there s,should further support future demand for low cost renewables as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial,
uh,fuel going forward and there s also i think clearly uh an opportunity to make green hydrogen to um to rep,s early and there s clearly an opportunity to you know five to ten years from now to displace or,
uh,an opportunity to make green hydrogen to um to rep uh to replace other types of hydrogen or and other feedstocks,an opportunity to you know five to ten years from now to displace or and other feedstocks in industrial applications,
uh,and we re not you know we re not being uh all of that in the end comes back to uh,and we re not you know we re not being all of that in the end comes back to a,
uh,uh all of that in the end comes back to uh a very important thing which is this is going to,being all of that in the end comes back to a very important thing which is this is going to,
uh,we re gonna be at the vanguard we re gonna uh and we re gonna this is a big strategic initiative,we were in battery storage we re going to be at the vanguard and this is a big strategic initiative,
uh,initiative for us and we re gonna drive it and uh it s gonna be very important uh for this company,initiative for us and we re going to drive it and it s going to be very important for this,
uh,drive it and uh it s gonna be very important uh for this company i think not you know over the,and we re going to drive it and it s going to be very important for this company in the,
uh,re dep we re deploying a billion dollars off batteries uh ten years later and so that s that s the,years and next year we re deploying a billion dollars of batteries 10 years later and so that s the,
uh,help powering the long term growth of this company into uh the back half of this decade and the and the,help powering the long term growth of this company into the back half for this decade and the next decade,
uh,other quick m a followup i was just wondering if uh is there any path for texas to be a target,other quick m a follow up wondering if there are any paths for texas to be a target of interest,
uh,would need to change there thanks so we we we uh we have uh spent a lot of time in texas,and any perspective or what would need to change there so we have spent a lot of time in texas,
uh,change there thanks so we we we uh we have uh spent a lot of time in texas obviously we own,or what would need to change there so we have spent a lot of time in texas obviously we own,
uh,in texas obviously we own assets in texas and so uh we are great operative and uh and and we feel,spent a lot of time in texas obviously we own assets in texas and so we are a great an,
uh,in texas and so uh we are great operative and uh and and we feel like we would bring an enormous,own assets in texas and so we are a great an enormous amount of state we own billions of dollars,
uh,know i would never say never um you know obviously uh we were extraordinarily disappointed in the encore decision we think,know it s early you know never say never on where we might find opportunities to invest in the business,
uh,extraordinarily disappointed in the encore decision we think it was uh uh a mistake and shortsighted but you know that is,you know i think it s early and there s clearly an opportunity to you know five to ten years,
uh,disappointed in the encore decision we think it was uh uh a mistake and shortsighted but you know that is what,in owning the electrolysis function within the supply chain and if so do you have kind of a vision or,
uh,shortsighted but you know that is what it is and uh so it s probably gonna take a bit to get,zero could be most economically served by hydrogen so that s what makes us excited about doing a pilot project,
uh,probably gonna take a bit to get past that before uh i i m super excited about doing things in texas,to zero could be most economically served by hydrogen so that s what makes us excited about doing a pilot,
uh,a second you re supposed to inaudible cases next year uh at both utilities and obviously the combination of it it,second you re supposed to file rate cases next year at both utilities and obviously the combination of it through,
uh,case or rate per week good morning michael and and uh we appreciate the uh the question um as as i,is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate rate the question as i,
uh,week good morning michael and and uh we appreciate the uh the question um as as i ve commented i think,you may not even need a rate case or rate rate the question as i ve commented i think even,
uh,change but that s the reality of operating any business uh you know what you know those days and and you,to invest in the business but historically as you know we ve not played in the space of owning you,
uh,gulf power um in these great opportunities that we see uh for the benefit of out customers you know we continue,invest at gulf tower in these great opportunities that that we see for the benefit of our customers we continue,
uh,would pull together and come up with our best ideas uh do we think over the long period of time that,we pull together and come up with our best ideas do we think over the long period of time that,
uh,drugstores in ecuador a full quarter of the agv operation uh in brazil and 45 days of the waxie and north,drugsters in ecuador a full quarter of the agv operation in brazil and 45 days of the waxi and north,
uh,it paid off and this is the approach and the uh and this is the approach and the discipline and what,months and we went to the market on three separate locations and this is the approach and the decision we,
uh,go first to ben theurer of barclays hey good morning uh thank you very much for taking me first i hope,our next question from sergio matsumoto a city yes hi good morning thank you for taking my question i have,
uh,quarter but if you could shed a little light on uh the current performance over the most recent weeks uh into,quarter but if you could shed a little light on the current performance of the most recent weeks into july,
uh,on uh the current performance over the most recent weeks uh into july where we ve seen uh more states uh,on the current performance of the most recent weeks into july where we see more states going into the orange,
uh,most recent weeks uh into july where we ve seen uh more states uh going into the the orange phase uh,most recent weeks into july where we see more states going into the orange face some of the re openings,
uh,uh into july where we ve seen uh more states uh going into the the orange phase uh some of the,of the most recent weeks into july where we see more states going into the orange face some of the,
uh,uh more states uh going into the the orange phase uh some of the reopenings and if you could also share,weeks into july where we see more states going into the orange face some of the re openings store closures,
uh,and if you could also share with us on the uh the the temporary store closures um how many you you,and et cetera do you have any color that you can share with us kind of there on the shift,
uh,still in place that would be my question thank you uh thank you ben uh uh let me tell you we,still in place that would be my question thank you thank you ben let me tell you we are making,
uh,would be my question thank you uh thank you ben uh uh let me tell you we we are making progress,in place that would be my question thank you thank you ben let me tell you we are making progress,
uh,be my question thank you uh thank you ben uh uh let me tell you we we are making progress uh,be my question thank you thank you ben let me tell you we are making progress the quarter 50 have,
uh,uh let me tell you we we are making progress uh as i said in the quarter 50 had had restrictions,my question thank you thank you ben let me tell you we are making progress the quarter 50 have restrictions,
uh,had restrictions now i would say 35 have restrictions the uh same store sales have improved a little bit uh mobility,50 have restrictions now i will say 35 have restrictions the sensor cells haven t proved a little bit it,
uh,the uh same store sales have improved a little bit uh mobility is is is coming still but but there s,will say 35 have restrictions the sensor cells haven t proved a little bit it s coming still but there,
uh,is is coming still but but there s still um uh if we you know if we uh uh we just,cells haven t proved a little bit it s coming still but there s still you know if we just,
uh,s still um uh if we you know if we uh uh we just pay attention let let s say to,a little bit it s coming still but there s still you know if we just pay attention yesterday to,
uh,still um uh if we you know if we uh uh we just pay attention let let s say to this,still you know if we just pay attention yesterday to the google mobility index and the google mobility index in,
uh,the go and moving and and and this is really uh being the major cause we think that people uh uh,make us very it goes on and and and i think it s a if you found that in the,
uh,really uh being the major cause we think that people uh uh are beginning to understand and adapt to this new,i mean also really lives by the people on the go and moving to understand and adapt to these new,
uh,uh being the major cause we think that people uh uh are beginning to understand and adapt to this new environment,mean also really lives by the people on the go and moving to understand and adapt to these new environments,
uh,production mobility too and i think it all depends that uh how what is going to happen with school systems in,mobility too and i think it all depends that how what is going to happen with school systems in the,
uh,is going to happen with school systems in the next uh um uh quarter uh what s going to happen with,that how what is going to happen with school systems in the next quarter what s going to happen with,
uh,to happen with school systems in the next uh um uh quarter uh what s going to happen with with uh,to happen with school systems in the next quarter what s going to happen with offices opening or keeping it,
uh,with school systems in the next uh um uh quarter uh what s going to happen with with uh offices opening,what is going to happen with school systems in the next quarter what s going to happen with offices opening,
uh,uh quarter uh what s going to happen with with uh offices opening or or keeping it closed so i think,quarter what s going to happen with offices opening or keeping it closed speaking the way that we are understanding,
uh,that we are understanding the pandemic better um you know uh i could tell that the uh lack of contagious of,that we are understanding the pandemic better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic,
uh,better um you know uh i could tell that the uh lack of contagious of um um um of this uh,better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is very low,
uh,uh lack of contagious of um um um of this uh pandemic in the stores is very low very very low,i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is very low very very low,
uh,the program that we have had with the the the uh the uh our personnel is more because the the lock,the parties that we have and the platforms that have been established and the opportunities for integration i m going,
uh,that we have had with the the the uh the uh our personnel is more because the the lock downs they,to the west coast of the u s north american has more of a midwest all the way down to,
uh,and and and most of the people that have had uh the the pandemic goes to the uh house not ne,of the larger players wax has a kind of a bias to the west coast of the u s north,
uh,that have had uh the the pandemic goes to the uh house not ne not really from from from the traffic,i said i think the pandemic has not forced the team down in brazil to depart very much from the,
uh,reallocating those resources to other locations or or maybe just uh trimming it in anticipation of uh you know more traditional,terms of maybe reallocating those resources to other locations or maybe just terming it in anticipation of being more traditional,
uh,or or maybe just uh trimming it in anticipation of uh you know more traditional headwinds in terms of the the,resources to other locations or maybe just terming it in anticipation of being more traditional headwinds in terms of the,
uh,downs that we had ha had the restrictions of alcoholic uh curfews or or lock downs or the possibility of open,lockdowns that we had had restrictions of alcoholic curfews open stores in certain commercial areas and that was the number,
uh,lock downs or the possibility of open stores in certain uh commercial areas and and uh that was the number that,that we had had restrictions of alcoholic curfews open stores in certain commercial areas and that was the number that,
uh,of open stores in certain uh commercial areas and and uh that was the number that we had around 50 have,of alcoholic curfews open stores in certain commercial areas and that was the number that we had around 50 have,
uh,50 have these kind of restrictions as i said now uh out of the 19 000 uh stores there are around,around 50 have these kind of restrictions as i said now out of the 19 000 stores there are about,
uh,as i said now uh out of the 19 000 uh stores there are around 7 000 that might that have,kind of restrictions as i said now out of the 19 000 stores there are about 7 000 that have,
uh,state of tamaulipas the previous weekend we were not allowed uh to to to sell we ha we have to we,ways that we grow we either take what we do well to a new geography or we take what we,
uh,not only not sell alcohol but to close the the uh completely the store and again i think the local authorities,there are about 7 000 that have had some kind of restrictions completely restored and again i think local authorities,
uh,against this pandemic some are effective and some are not uh i would say and and and but the thing is,of stores and we ve had some asset write downs both at colt femsa and at femsa so i think,
uh,the way we we we work with the stores um uh i think another problem is really through the lockdown the,i think what we have for the future is kind of painful but i think it s what the right,
uh,very very weak um and and we have had some uh besides the the lockdown restrictions that we have with some,i think local authorities are trying to best adapt and have bound restrictions that we are going to have some,
uh,have with some authorities or selling of alcohol in some uh some stores also we are really closing some of the,have some authority or sending a lot to hold and some stores also we are really imposing some of the,
uh,but again we think that it will be temporary and uh and we are adapting the best we can thank you,consumers around but again we think that will be temporary and we are adapting the best we can thank you,
uh,good morning everyone thanks for the thanks for the questions uh considering the timing of this crisis that that came right,good morning gentlemen thanks for the call most of my questions have been answered but if i may just insist,
uh,challenging start now in the in the sense of direction uh you know we we re very happy with the uh,and we are adapting the best we can thank you very much you know we re very happy with our,
uh,uh you know we we re very happy with the uh with our partners and with the companies we acquired uh,much you know we re very happy with our partners and with the companies we acquired they are in the,
uh,uh with our partners and with the companies we acquired uh they are in the jan san business and as as,re very happy with our partners and with the companies we acquired they are in the janssen business and as,
uh,business and as as you imagine jan has had a uh uh uh uh a great uh uh demand uh for,the companies we acquired they are in the janssen business and as you imagine janssen has a great demand for,
uh,and as as you imagine jan has had a uh uh uh uh a great uh uh demand uh for for,and as you imagine janssen has a great demand for the products out of the two waxi is more focused,

uh,demand uh for for the products out of the two uh waxie is more focused to jan san and north american,has a great demand for the products out of the two waxi is more focused to jensen and north american,
uh,platform and in fact north american had had to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and,platform that we re looking at and i think we already have so we don t think to open a,
uh,fact north american had had to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and i think probably,of the u s north american has more of a midwest all the way down to florida coverage but you,
uh,north american had had to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and i think probably that,well to find the problem that we are left out in the country and i think by testing that we,
uh,had had to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and i think probably that is the,well to find the problem that we are left out in the country and i think by testing that we,
uh,had to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and i think probably that is the one,well to find the problem that we are left out in the country and i think by testing that we,
uh,to sell uh to some uh uh hospitality uh uh uh customers and i think probably that is the one that,left out in the country and i think by testing that we have a good price but i think that,
uh,with them we have great partners and i think that uh we are uh going to build an extraordinary platform with,extraordinarily happy with him we have great partners and i think that we are going to build a historic platform,
uh,have great partners and i think that uh we are uh going to build an extraordinary platform with the help of,have great partners and i think that we are going to build a historic platform with the help of them,
uh,an extraordinary platform with the help of them and and uh we look forward with a very optimistic uh uh uh,going to build a historic platform with the help of them and we look forward with a very optimistic future,
uh,and and uh we look forward with a very optimistic uh uh uh uh future yeah i i think i would,historic platform with the help of them and we look forward with a very optimistic future i think i would,
uh,and uh we look forward with a very optimistic uh uh uh uh future yeah i i think i would add,platform with the help of them and we look forward with a very optimistic future i think i would add,

uh,we look forward with a very optimistic uh uh uh uh future yeah i i think i would add um uh,we look forward with a very optimistic future i think i would add let me get this one on the,
uh,uh future yeah i i think i would add um uh miguel this is juan um even on the on the,we look forward with a very optimistic future i think i would add let me get this one on the,
uh,restaurant depot which is also one of the recent investments uh which being as exposed as they are to the restaurant,me get this one on the jeta restaurant depot which is also one of the recent investments which being been,
uh,being as exposed as they are to the restaurant sector uh one would think or at least one would have thought,think i would add let me get this one on the jeta restaurant depot which is also one of the,
uh,at least one would have thought a few months ago uh that this would be a complicated period for them and,in fact if you look at agv the company that we acquired a few months ago you know their it,
uh,not saying it it hasn t been complicated but certainly uh they have been uh adjusting and navigating the situation uh,also one of the recent investments which being been complicated but certainly they have been adjusting and navigating the situation,
uh,hasn t been complicated but certainly uh they have been uh adjusting and navigating the situation uh quite frankly exceeding exceeding,the recent investments which being been complicated but certainly they have been adjusting and navigating the situation quite frankly exceeding,
uh,uh they have been uh adjusting and navigating the situation uh quite frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations uh,they have been adjusting and navigating the situation quite frankly exceeding at least my personal expectations which kind of confirms,
uh,uh quite frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations uh which uh kind of confirms our view that this is,navigating the situation quite frankly exceeding at least my personal expectations which kind of confirms our view that this is,
uh,frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations uh which uh kind of confirms our view that this is a very,situation quite frankly exceeding at least my personal expectations which kind of confirms our view that this is a very,
uh,and very well run company so they have been doing uh as i said better than better than expected adjusting and,well positioned and very well run company so they have been doing as i said better than expected adjusting and,
uh,than expected adjusting and i think their customers as well uh the little restaurants adapting to you know curbside delivery um,than expected adjusting and i think their customers as well the little restaurants adapting to curbside delivery and things begin,
uh,your mute function we re unable to hear you hi uh are you listening me now yes please go ahead with,check your mute function we re unable to hear you hi are you losing me now yes please go ahead,
uh,okay hi juan hi eduardo i hope you are well uh just two quick que que questions here from my side,ahead okay okay hi hello hi eduardo hope you are well well just two quick questions here from my side,
uh,from my side the first one is about g a uh i saw that uh basically your g a uh increased,two quick questions here from my side the first one is about dna i saw that basically your dna increased,
uh,first one is about g a uh i saw that uh basically your g a uh increased uh across the business,here from my side the first one is about dna i saw that basically your dna increased across the business,
uh,a uh i saw that uh basically your g a uh increased uh across the business divisions so just to understand,the first one is about dna i saw that basically your dna increased across the business division just to understand,
uh,i saw that uh basically your g a uh increased uh across the business divisions so just to understand what s,one is about dna i saw that basically your dna increased across the business division just to understand what s,
uh,understand what s driving such increase and secondly very briefly uh if you can give views uh your impressions about the,understand what s driving such increase and secondly very briefly if you can give you your impressions about the mexican,
uh,and secondly very briefly uh if you can give views uh your impressions about the mexican pension reform in terms of,increase and secondly very briefly if you can give you your impressions about the mexican pension reform in terms of,
uh,will go to to the second one and i think uh i ll let juan answer the first one the the,will go to the second one and i think net one answer the first one the pressure reform i think,
uh,we altogether tried to solve it because it will be uh very difficult for the current environment to to to solve,we all together try to solve it because it will be very difficult for the criminal movement to solve and,
uh,economic environment in mexico i think what we have in uh for the future is is is kind of painful but,could disrupt the economic environment in mexico i think what we have for the future is kind of painful but,
uh,the right thing to do and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the,painful but i think it s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the,
uh,thing to do and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the government i,i think it s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government i,
uh,do and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the government i think it,it s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government i think it,
uh,and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the government i think it s,s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government i think it s,
uh,i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the government i think it s it,what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government i think it s to,
uh,here to to fix the hole for the long run uh and the other one uh juan why don t you,aligned and build certain things and trust in the relationship for the long run so the tenure of the last,
uh,hole for the long run uh and the other one uh juan why don t you go and try to answer,is very important for the long run and also and as i said we love and i think the main,
uh,question please yes hi marcella so we we are having uh some uh amortization of it investments uh i think on,the very first question please yes hi marcela so we are having some amortization of it investments i think on,

uh,that would be playing uh a part on that obviously uh we can we can also follow up offline in terms,that would be playing a part on that obviously we can also follow up offline in terms of making the,
uh,think off the top of our heads that those are uh concepts that come to mind okay thank you thank you,think of the top of our heads that those are questions that come to mind okay thank you thank you,
uh,next we will go to gustavo oliveira of ubs hi uh good morning everyone thank you thank you for taking my,next we will go to gustavo olivierea of ubs hi good morning everyone thank you for taking my question it,
uh,morning everyone thank you thank you for taking my question uh it s on oxxo uh gross margin you mentioned that,morning everyone thank you for taking my question it s on also gross margin you mentioned that your numbers are,
uh,you for taking my question uh it s on oxxo uh gross margin you mentioned that uh you your your numbers,good morning everyone thank you for taking my question it s on also gross margin you mentioned that your numbers,
uh,it s on oxxo uh gross margin you mentioned that uh you your your numbers are actually very good uh there,you for taking my question it s on also gross margin you mentioned that your numbers are actually very good,
uh,that uh you your your numbers are actually very good uh there was a very little contraction there you mentioned that,that your numbers are actually very good do you think that you could actually see an expansion here of gross,
uh,was offset by by the service category on the recovery uh do you think that you could actually see an expansion,very good do you think that you could actually see an expansion here of gross margin i don t know,
uh,as the i don t know if the service category uh really remains strong uh and the beer clearly could recover,don t know if the service category we remain strong and the beer clearly could recover could you please elaborate,
uh,t know if the service category uh really remains strong uh and the beer clearly could recover uh could you please,know if the service category we remain strong and the beer clearly could recover could you please elaborate a bit,
uh,really remains strong uh and the beer clearly could recover uh could you please elaborate a bit on on the trend,service category we remain strong and the beer clearly could recover could you please elaborate a bit on the trend,
uh,our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack the uh lack of consumer uh uh uh uh economic strength but,margin for oxo let me give you our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack of consumer economics time,
uh,are concerned with the lack the uh lack of consumer uh uh uh uh economic strength but what we re trying,give you our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack of consumer economics time but what we re trying,
uh,concerned with the lack the uh lack of consumer uh uh uh uh economic strength but what we re trying to,you our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack of consumer economics time but what we re trying to,
uh,with the lack the uh lack of consumer uh uh uh uh economic strength but what we re trying to do,our suppliers and us are concerned with the lack of consumer economics time but what we re trying to do,
uh,the lack the uh lack of consumer uh uh uh uh economic strength but what we re trying to do is,suppliers and us are concerned with the lack of consumer economics time but what we re trying to do is,
uh,really estimate dema the demand um and here we are uh we have our our our our our suppliers and our,come up with different offerings to really just to make them demand and here we have our suppliers and our,
uh,suppliers and our partners and and trying to do something uh great for them for the consumer in in in uh,suppliers and our partners and i m trying to do something great for them for the consumer in current times,
uh,uh great for them for the consumer in in in uh in in in covid times but i don t know,partners and i m trying to do something great for them for the consumer in current times margin i mean,
uh,in in in covid times but i don t know uh juan why do you go and and go for the,efficiencies is to come into place to perform better i don t know who you want to add to the,
uh,juan why do you go and and go for the uh details of the numbers please sure uh i i think,on that obviously we can also follow up offline in terms of making the numbers match but i i think,
uh,go for the uh details of the numbers please sure uh i i think on the gross margin i mean historically,and i m trying to do something great for them for the consumer in current times margin i mean historically,
uh,gross margin expansion have been the financial services category and uh you know uh the commercial income that we that we,gross margin expansion have been the financial services category and you know the commercial income that we that we receive,
uh,have been the financial services category and uh you know uh the commercial income that we that we receive from our,expansion have been the financial services category and you know the commercial income that we that we receive from our,
uh,income that we that we receive from our from our uh supplier partners right now as eduardo ha has said um,commercial income that we that we receive from our from our supplier partners right now as eduardo has said i,
uh,surprise has been the resilience and even the you know uh faster growth of financial services during the downturn um as,positive surprise has been the resilience and even the you know faster growth of financial services during the downturn as,
uh,less in recent quarters in the last two three quarters uh this quarter it actually uh the growth came came in,and we saw the steepest contractions in traffic making the worst months of the quarter finally in june we began,
uh,the last two three quarters uh this quarter it actually uh the growth came came in the in the high single,synergy component the aspiration to integrate more of these assets at the right time and in the right way is,
uh,to the to a high gross margin the other question uh on commercial income is a little bit trickier uh because,that the pandemic will cost and the third and last question have to do with capital deployment i mean i,
uh,question uh on commercial income is a little bit trickier uh because you know so uh some of those agreements as,certain things and trust in the relationship for the long run so the tenure of the last agreement was a,
uh,is a little bit trickier uh because you know so uh some of those agreements as eduardo also referred to um,for the long run so the tenure of the last agreement was a 10 year agreement this one you just,
uh,s hard to predict i mean we we do need uh volumes to come up uh transactions to go up for,s hard to tell at this point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months,
uh,mean we we do need uh volumes to come up uh transactions to go up for commercial income to go up,time but what we re trying to do is to come up with different offerings to really just to make,
uh,transactions to go up for commercial income to go up uh you know in consequence so i would say visibility for,transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters but if they were i think we would be,
uh,expand it um you know more than more than trend uh but at least during the during the second quarter uh,digits which was a positive surprise and i think contributes to the high but at least during the second quarter,
uh,uh but at least during the during the second quarter uh it did uh kind of hold its own thank you,contributes to the high but at least during the second quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you,
uh,least during the during the second quarter uh it did uh kind of hold its own thank you i think it,but at least during the second quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you i think it s,
uh,i think it s very clear thank you thank you uh i would also add that probably the uh uh there,thank you i think it s very clear thank you thank you i will also add that probably the there,
uh,thank you uh i would also add that probably the uh uh there there were a small increase also in in,clear thank you thank you i will also add that probably the there were a small increase also in and,
uh,you uh i would also add that probably the uh uh there there were a small increase also in in in,clear thank you thank you i will also add that probably the there were a small increase also in and,
uh,there were a small increase also in in in in uh the lack of beer also uh shift demand to uh,that probably the there were a small increase also in and the lack of beer also shift the man to,
uh,in in in in uh the lack of beer also uh shift demand to uh to some other alcoholic beverages and,small increase also in and the lack of beer also shift the man to some of the alcoholic beverages and,
uh,uh the lack of beer also uh shift demand to uh to some other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh,increase also in and the lack of beer also shift the man to some of the alcoholic beverages and those,
uh,uh to some other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh have uh uh that compensated the margin a little bit,some of the alcoholic beverages and those have let s say demarcated a little bit too and that actually brings,
uh,some other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh have uh uh that compensated the margin a little bit too and,alcoholic beverages and those have let s say demarcated a little bit too and that actually brings up an interesting,
uh,other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh have uh uh that compensated the margin a little bit too and that,alcoholic beverages and those have let s say demarcated a little bit too and that actually brings up an interesting,
uh,too and that it actually brings up an interesting point uh eduardo because you know obviously you re you re you,too and that actually brings up an interesting point a lot of all because obviously your that the volume for,
uh,you know obviously you re you re you re right uh consumers did uh shift to uh higher consumption of spirits,you know as you merge the two companies you come up with a bunch of synergies and so forth what,
uh,you re you re you re right uh consumers did uh shift to uh higher consumption of spirits uh during the,high single digits which was a positive surprise and i think contributes to the high but at least during the,
uh,re you re right uh consumers did uh shift to uh higher consumption of spirits uh during the quarter um and,stores the amount of temporary closures was enough to set the number of stores we opened during the quarter and,
uh,consumers did uh shift to uh higher consumption of spirits uh during the quarter um and interestingly i think what what,closures was enough to set the number of stores we opened during the quarter and what are the 28 total,
uh,quarter um and interestingly i think what what the oxxo uh our oxxo colleagues were observing in recent weeks was that,at the right time and in the right way is a big part of i think the aspiration that we,
uh,beer came back that the volume for spirits was still uh holding up strong so maybe you know if uh in,interesting point a lot of all because obviously your that the volume for spirits was still holding up strong lining,
uh,still uh holding up strong so maybe you know if uh in the in the effort to look for the for,you know we got as high as 1350 i think at the top taking this opportunity to look at the,
uh,the for the silver lining or the glass half full uh you know as consumers realize what the assortment and the,for spirits was still holding up strong lining or the glass half full consumers realize what the assortment and the,
uh,the assortment and the the pricing is for for spirits uh at the oxxo stores that this becomes a category that,realize what the assortment and the pricing is for spirits at the oxford stores that this becomes a category that,
uh,oxxo stores that this becomes a category that that is uh you know that is stronger than that historically because historically,pricing is for spirits at the oxford stores that this becomes a category that is stronger than historically because historically,
uh,hopefully this remains after the after the pandemic is is uh gone and we ll move on to our next question,right now so hopefully this remains after the pandemic is gone and we ll move on to our next question,
uh,thanks for the for the space for questions so here uh i wanted to to get your thoughts a little bit,next to ulysses arkate hi everyone thanks for the space for questions share any color on what you re seeing,
uh,get your thoughts a little bit on on any potential uh product portfolio rationalization there there in oxxo uh and maybe,a v shape it s a little bit of a strong the scripture but certainly the trough of the trend,
uh,any potential uh product portfolio rationalization there there in oxxo uh and maybe if you can share any any color on,alan i ll go next to ulysses arkate hi everyone thanks for the space for questions share any color on,
uh,to the more profitable categories that you guys have there uh thank you you know unless we think that this uh,to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that this lack,
uh,uh thank you you know unless we think that this uh lack of mobility will stay for a very long period,there thank you you know unless we think that this lack of community will stay for a very long period,
uh,will stay for a very long period of time um uh which we not which we we don t think it,we think that this lack of community will stay for a very long period which we don t think it,
uh,to the um um lack of of of consumer economic uh power and and by by probably with a different assortment,there and we have to adapt more to the lack of consumer economic power by probably with a different assortment,
uh,for cheaper or or less expensive products um our returnable uh uh cun uh uh uh soft drinks uh is is,for cheaper or less expensive products where returnable soft drinks is not as strong as we should have it now,

uh,depending on uh we think that eventually uh those those uh type of of consumer demand will stay it is more,break fast or people gathering depending on we think that eventually those type of consumer demand will stay is more,
uh,the consumer that we re more concerned than than the uh real shift of of our consumer occasions that that s,economic power of the consumer that we re more concerned than the real ship of ocular tumor patients that s,
uh,june july after the the beer category s backend etc uh do you have any any color that you can share,june july after the beer category is back and et cetera do you have any color that you can share,
uh,highlight and i think eduardo touched on it in his uh opening remarks was that um the quarter itself was a,of highlight and i think eduardo touched on it in his opening itself was a little bit of a i,
uh,um the quarter itself was a little bit of a uh i don t know if a v shape is a,his opening itself was a little bit of a i don t know if a v shape it s a,
uh,a v shape is a little bit of a strong uh descriptor but certainly the the the trough of the of,a v shape it s a little bit of a strong the scripture but certainly the trough of the trend,
uh,was the month of may um and we believe that uh we hope and believe that will mark the the lowest,was the month of may and we believe of may and then as the beer comes back it helps everything,
uh,that will mark the the lowest point of this downturn uh should be the month of may um and then as,but certainly the trough of the trend was the month of may and we believe of may and then as,
uh,of may um and then as as beer comes back uh it it it helps everything right it it helps operating,may and we believe of may and then as the beer comes back it helps everything right it helps operating,
uh,it it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and uh generally begins to to turn this into a uh uh,it helps everything right it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and generally begins to turn this into a,
uh,and uh generally begins to to turn this into a uh uh a more traditional downturn so so to speak um,and generally begins to turn this into a more traditional downturn so to speak and so as i said in,
uh,uh generally begins to to turn this into a uh uh a more traditional downturn so so to speak um and,leverage and it helps margins and generally begins to turn this into a more traditional downturn so to speak and,
uh,so so to speak um and so you know the uh as eduardo said in the beginning we we are seeing,this into a more traditional downturn so to speak and so as i said in the beginning we are seeing,
uh,beginning we we are seeing improving improving metrics and improving uh traffic and and uh really the the one concern i,beginning we are seeing improving metrics and improving traffic and really the one concern i have is not to convey,
uh,seeing improving improving metrics and improving uh traffic and and uh really the the one concern i have is not to,beginning we are seeing improving metrics and improving traffic and really the one concern i have is not to convey,
uh,restrictions are are gone that we go back to normal uh immediately right because we are seeing these uh symptoms and,restrictions that we are going to have some authority or sending a lot to hold and some stores also we,
uh,to normal uh immediately right because we are seeing these uh symptoms and and signs of a of a more traditional,everything right it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and generally begins to turn this into a more traditional,
uh,and signs of a of a more traditional economic driven uh downturn but uh again you know you when you go,another set of more traditional economic headwinds coming to play this is not possible but at least we have more,
uh,a of a more traditional economic driven uh downturn but uh again you know you when you go when you go,these remain a problem another set of more traditional economic headwinds coming to play this is not possible but at,
uh,and this has never happened before on the beer side uh obviously you have both of our suppliers on the beer,an interesting point a lot of all because obviously your that the volume for spirits was still holding up strong,
uh,you have both of our suppliers on the beer front uh working hard to restock the the shelves um consumers themselves,we have our suppliers and our partners and i m trying to do something great for them for the consumer,
uh,buying a little bit more beer than they normally do uh to make sure they don t go dry again and,a little bit lower than the top that we reached a couple years ago but you know we were already,
uh,dry again and so you know you you re seeing uh positive trends on on on some of these uh important,they are learning a lot in fact they are learning and they are going to be adapt some of the,
uh,seeing uh positive trends on on on some of these uh important categories especially beer um so i would expect that,is not to convey the view that once the mobility restrictions of packaging and mix for some important categories i,
uh,um so i would expect that to to continue and uh you know we we will obviously make the adjustments uh,but i think we ll be able to meet again got it thank you so much now we will go,
uh,uh you know we we will obviously make the adjustments uh eduardo referenced some in terms of of uh packaging and,you know obviously the pandemic throws a little bit of sand into the gears in terms of the phase of,
uh,the adjustments uh eduardo referenced some in terms of of uh packaging and and and mix for some important categories um,is not to convey the view that once the mobility restrictions of packaging and mix for some important categories i,
uh,and what the new normal eventually ends up looking like uh in the sense that we will i m sure adapt,what the new normal eventually ends up looking like in the sense that we we will i m sure adapt,
uh,will i m sure adapt our value proposition to that uh whether it means uh you know some incremental skus or,we we will i m sure adapt our valuable position to that whether it means you know some incremental skus,
uh,adapt our value proposition to that uh whether it means uh you know some incremental skus or a shift in the,sure adapt our valuable position to that whether it means you know some incremental skus or a shift in the,
uh,of thing so so we re we re still not uh at the end of this uh but we know more,of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of this but we know more about,
uh,we re still not uh at the end of this uh but we know more about how the consumer is uh,of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of this but we know more about,
uh,uh but we know more about how the consumer is uh adjusting habits than we did a couple months ago um,but we know more about adjusting habits than we did a couple months ago and we are acting in consequence,
uh,the result of this quarter i guess the question is uh is is this result putting to question the business model,the market to your point in terms of how you find the question is still kind of getting its hands,
uh,this is the first quarter ever that you closed stores uh so i guess the specific question is um and and,that s the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those,
uh,question is um and and sorry if i missed it uh what what s the expectation regarding store openings going forward,question juan thank you thank you bravo yes i do alan s first attempt at the question didn t work,
uh,of oxxo in in in the medium and long run uh i think we have a extraordinary platform and and and,my questions thank you so much individual long run i think we have a good public platform and it s,
uh,i think we have a extraordinary platform and and and uh it s it s just that we have uh the,much individual long run i think we have a good public platform and it s just that we have the,
uh,and uh it s it s just that we have uh the right consumer uh uh uh the adjustments and and,think we have a good public platform and it s just that we have the current platforms like amazon and,
uh,it s just that we have uh the right consumer uh uh uh the adjustments and and and the lack of,it s just that we have the current platforms like amazon and everything we are very optimistic with those two,
uh,s just that we have uh the right consumer uh uh uh the adjustments and and and the lack of mobility,country and i think by testing that we have a good price but i think that category lack of mobility,
uh,just that we have uh the right consumer uh uh uh the adjustments and and and the lack of mobility that,the there were a small increase also in and the lack of beer also shift the man to some of,
uh,commerce we re we re very much mm hmm affirmative uh uh uh uh we are doing things that we are,a more diverse platform we re extraordinarily happy with him we have great partners and i think that we are,
uh,we re we re very much mm hmm affirmative uh uh uh uh we are doing things that we are not,we re extraordinarily happy with him we have great partners and i think that we are going to build a,
uh,re we re very much mm hmm affirmative uh uh uh uh we are doing things that we are not prepared,reform i think is this whole web there and i think it s a good thing that we all together,
uh,we re very much mm hmm affirmative uh uh uh uh we are doing things that we are not prepared yet,think is this whole web there and i think it s a good thing that we all together try to,
uh,disclose but i think we are in in the financial uh in the financial sector we see the evolution there and,the jd we made in the field and also with all the partnerships that we have here in the united,
uh,related and connected with the international platform um we we uh the current the current uh the if if you want,think we have a good public platform and it s just that we have the current platforms like amazon and,
uh,international platform um we we uh the current the current uh the if if you want to see uh those are,so they don t have these cash currents problem that this pandemic will cost to them so those are the,
uh,the current uh the if if you want to see uh those are the uh the ones uh the linkages that,i don t know if you want to add to this one i mean just the point that i think,
uh,if if you want to see uh those are the uh the ones uh the linkages that we are making with,i don t know if you want to add to this one i mean just the point that i think,
uh,want to see uh those are the uh the ones uh the linkages that we are making with the current platforms,think we made the right decision with the companies in west with the parties that we have and the platforms,
uh,current platforms like amazon and everything we are very optimistic uh with those two what we don t know yet is,current platforms like amazon and everything we are very optimistic with those two what we don t know yet is,
uh,we don t know yet is the mm hmm affirmative uh the uh uh home delivery home delivery still we don,very optimistic with those two what we don t know yet is the home delivery home delivery still we don,

uh,be delivering a lot of things for the for the uh for homes because ec economically those make sense and the,without doubt that will be delivering a lot of things for the homes because economically those make sense and the,
uh,but i think there are still some learnings and and uh efficiencies to come uh to come in into place to,some backstores and everything but i think there s still some learning and efficiencies is to come into place to,
uh,are still some learnings and and uh efficiencies to come uh to come in into place to to perform better i,everything but i think there s still some learning and efficiencies is to come into place to perform better i,
uh,better i don t know if you want to add uh uh uh uh to the question juan thank you yeah,better i don t know who you want to add to the question juan thank you thank you bravo yes,

uh,eduardo yes i do laugh i think alan s first uh attempt at the question didn t work but the second,you thank you bravo yes i do alan s first attempt at the question didn t work but the second,
uh,try to to to add to to some of these uh so on the store front uh alan you know i,big topics so i will try to add to some of these so on the forefront alan you know i,
uh,to some of these uh so on the store front uh alan you know i think what what we re seeing,to some of these so on the forefront alan you know i think what we re seeing is you know,
uh,you know i think what what we re seeing is uh you know we we have for a number of years,alan you know i think what we re seeing is you know we have for for a number of years,
uh,ve been opening more stores every year than the previous uh you know we got as high as 1 350 i,ve been opening more stores every year than the previous you know we got as high as 1350 i think,
uh,re doing right now is we re taking this opportunity uh to look at the you know the you know that,at the top taking this opportunity to look at the you know there s a layer of stores that are,
uh,out which of those stores actually should not be open uh kind of pruning the the base of a small uh,you know there s a layer of stores that are number of stores that should not be open and just,
uh,uh kind of pruning the the base of a small uh number of stores that that should not be open and,the you know there s a layer of stores that are number of stores that should not be open and,
uh,that should not be open and just generally i think uh you know the the budget for stores this year before,number of stores that should not be open and just generally i think the budget for stores this year before,
uh,than the top that we reached a couple years ago uh but you know we we were already kind of moving,lower than the top that we reached a couple years ago but you know we were already kind of moving,
uh,you expect of your new stores in order to ensure uh profitability and productivity of the new stores and at the,you expect of your new stores in order to ensure profitability and productivity of the new stores and at the,

uh,but more of a of a of a continental story uh so we are at that stage and i think this,just a mexico story but more of a continental story so we are at that stage and i think this,

uh,we have uh the you know both portfolios of beers uh that there will be a large number of locations in,western mexico now that we have both portfolios of beers that there will be a large number of locations in,
uh,large number of locations in places like guadalajara leon queretaro uh even the the valley of mexico where uh the fact,be a large number of locations in places like guadalajara león querétaro even the valley of mexico where the fact,
uh,leon queretaro uh even the the valley of mexico where uh the fact that you now have um the abi portfolio,places like guadalajara león querétaro even the valley of mexico where the fact that you now have the adi portfolio,
uh,the fact that you now have um the abi portfolio uh kind of takes a lot of those locations that were,where the fact that you now have the adi portfolio kind of takes a lot of those locations that were,
uh,being viable makes them viable um and again kind of uh you know ensures that we can contin continue to open,kind of getting its hands around you know why it is that we made a couple of investments in the,
uh,front i mean eduardo touched on it in terms of uh also obviously realizing the the potential and the power of,and i think eduardo touched on it in his opening itself was a little bit of a i don t,
uh,um to bankarize people or to get people to adopt uh new technologies or new products i mean i think we,portfolio kind of takes a lot of those locations that were just technologies or new products and i think we,
uh,the saldazo experience that gives us a lot of comfort uh in terms of our ability to get people to sign,the salbasso experience that gives us a lot of comfort in terms of our ability to get people to sign,
uh,ability to get people to sign up and and adopt uh um new new means of payment or new means of,ability to get people to sign up and adopt new means of payment or new means of saving but one,
uh,of payment or new means of of of of saving uh but one thing we don t want to do is,adopt new means of payment or new means of saving but one thing we don t want to do is,
uh,want to do is to overpromise and and underdeliver so uh we are working hard at uh the three legged stool,want to do is to over promise and under deliver so we are working hard at the three legged stool,
uh,and and underdeliver so uh we are working hard at uh the three legged stool of uh our digital platform at,over promise and under deliver so we are working hard at the three legged stool of our digital platform at,
uh,are working hard at uh the three legged stool of uh our digital platform at at oxxo which involves last mile,so we are working hard at the three legged stool of our digital platform at oxo which market toward the,
uh,digital platform at at oxxo which involves last mile delivery uh and i think more importantly the loyalty program and the,our digital platform at oxo which market toward the end of the year and then finally in capital deployment i,
uh,more importantly the loyalty program and the e wallet and uh hopefully we ll have something to show the market uh,mind for the team and hopefully we are in the process of addressing got it got it now thank you,
uh,uh hopefully we ll have something to show the market uh you know towards the end of the year and then,the three legged stool of our digital platform at oxo which market toward the end of the year and then,
uh,end of the year and then finally on capital deployment uh i mean you know you ve seen us for over,of the year and then finally in capital deployment i mean you ve seen us for over the years femsa,
uh,basically has a couple of ways that that we grow uh we either take what we do well to a new,basically it has a couple of ways that we grow we either take what we do well to a new,
uh,business where you took kind of oxxo and and expanded uh what it does by a few degrees and and you,business where you took kind of opso into drugstores so i think what we re doing right now and i,
uh,we re doing right now and i think the market uh to your point in in terms of how you frame,we re doing right now and i think the market to your point in terms of how you find the,
uh,point in in terms of how you frame the question uh it s still kind of getting its hands around uh,point in terms of how you find the question is still kind of getting its hands around you know why,
uh,uh it s still kind of getting its hands around uh you know why it is that we made a couple,the question is still kind of getting its hands around you know why it is that we made a couple,
uh,the org chart um we will try to address that uh to the extent that we can by increasing the disclosure,thank you thank you i will also add that probably the there were a small increase also in and the,
uh,re going to start opening up the numbers for s uh the logistics business as well as for the jan san,re going to start opening up the numbers for the logistics business as well as for the janssen business first,
uh,logistics business as well as for the jan san business uh first quarter of next year um so you know capital,logistics business as well as for the janssen business first quarter of next year of deployment these investments and addressing,
uh,quarter of next year um so you know capital deployment uh these investments and and and addressing the complexity that it,as for the janssen business first quarter of next year of deployment these investments and addressing the complexity that it,
uh,complexity that it brings to the equation are very much uh top of mind for for the team and and hopefully,addressing the complexity that it brings to the equation are very much top of mind for the team and hopefully,
uh,something very humbly and things that you already know but uh amazon tesla facebook uh all of these companies started without,of this point i mean i know i m gonna say amazon tesla facebook all of these companies started without,
uh,things that you already know but uh amazon tesla facebook uh all of these companies started without making money initially and,mean i know i m gonna say amazon tesla facebook all of these companies started without making money initially the,
uh,all of these companies started without making money initially and uh they just and you gained the scale and uh these,m gonna say amazon tesla facebook all of these companies started without making money initially the biggest scale and this,
uh,and uh they just and you gained the scale and uh these colombian guys rappi it s a question mark if,started without making money initially the biggest scale and this colombian guy is wrapping it s a question mark if,
uh,get in you probably won t make money either but uh once you get the scale eventually i think consumers will,it probably won t make money either but once you get the scale eventually i think consumers will pay a,
uh,you alan i mean i ll just wrap that question uh you know the the the concept or the notion of,using your muscle thank you i mean i just wrote that question you know the concept or the notion of,
uh,apps and how in in other in other geographies obviously uh things have evolved very quickly uh but we do have,notion of the super apps and how in other geographies obviously things have evolved very quickly but we do have,
uh,in other geographies obviously uh things have evolved very quickly uh but we do have the aspiration with the you know,in other geographies obviously things have evolved very quickly but we do have the aspiration with the right platform and,

uh,to imagine many will will not go on their course uh and on the other hand higher unemployment may push many,on the state optimum pop stores in mexico and on the other hand higher unemployment may push many to sort,
uh,you re seeing on the ground would be appreciated well uh i i i think the mom and pops were hardly,talking about what you re seeing on the ground would be appreciated well i think the moment was where hardly,
uh,unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was uh uh uh uh um and and and and also the,think the moment was where hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was and also the,
uh,because of the lack of beer and that was uh uh uh uh um and and and and also the lack,the moment was where hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was and also the lack,

uh,beer in cigarettes i think we were able to to uh to uh um prepare ourselves with good inventories and but,going to be here in cigarettes i think we were able to prepare ourselves with the good inventories and but,
uh,cigarettes i think we were able to to uh to uh um prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again the,be here in cigarettes i think we were able to prepare ourselves with the good inventories and but again the,
uh,um prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again the uh so those two were uh major uh uh they have,were able to prepare ourselves with the good inventories and but again the so those two were major they have,
uh,inventories and but again the uh so those two were uh major uh uh they have major effects on that uh,inventories and but again the so those two were major they have major effects on it in the other hand,
uh,but again the uh so those two were uh major uh uh they have major effects on that uh in the,the good inventories and but again the so those two were major they have major effects on it in the,
uh,again the uh so those two were uh major uh uh they have major effects on that uh in the other,good inventories and but again the so those two were major they have major effects on it in the other,
uh,uh major uh uh they have major effects on that uh in the other hand i think the um the traditional,the so those two were major they have major effects on it in the other hand i think the traditional,
uh,are and i think the ones that are in the uh neighborhoods i think they are they are coming up with,one and i think net one answer the first one the pressure reform i think is this whole web there,
uh,are they are coming up with a with a good uh uh performance i would say also that that we are,was a major role i think they re coming up with a good performance i would say also they were,
uh,they are coming up with a with a good uh uh performance i would say also that that we are better,a major role i think they re coming up with a good performance i would say also they were better,
uh,returnable soft drinks compared with with oxxo so that was uh uh uh a small advantage but yes ag again i,in the returnable bottles that the returnable something compared with also so that was as more advantage yes again i,
uh,soft drinks compared with with oxxo so that was uh uh uh a small advantage but yes ag again i i,something compared with also so that was as more advantage yes again i think they will recuperate because i think,
uh,drinks compared with with oxxo so that was uh uh uh a small advantage but yes ag again i i think,the returnable bottles that the returnable something compared with also so that was as more advantage yes again i think,
uh,i i think they will recuperate because i think the uh uh the coca cola system bimbo and and alike are,as more advantage yes again i think they will recuperate because i think the quality system bimboa and adelaide are,
uh,i think they will recuperate because i think the uh uh the coca cola system bimbo and and alike are very,more advantage yes again i think they will recuperate because i think the quality system bimboa and adelaide are very,
uh,very much wi willing to support and and and help uh and and uh help them to to compete and and,very much willing to support and help and help them to compete so i do see that the pandemic those,
uh,willing to support and and and help uh and and uh help them to to compete and and and so i,quality system bimboa and adelaide are very much willing to support and help and help them to compete so i,
uh,the they were very hardly hit the ones that have uh lack of beer in in in during this uh initial,to sustain but yes they were very hard to hit the ones that have lack of beer during these initial,
uh,have uh lack of beer in in in during this uh initial period of the downturn great thank you and and,have lack of beer during these initial periods of their downturn great thank you question i guess you have taken,
uh,to the last question i guess um you you have uh taken some stakes in in certain startups um and i,periods of their downturn great thank you question i guess you have taken some stakes in certain startups and i,
uh,in in certain startups um and i have seen that uh one of those uh justo uh have been uh growing,have taken some stakes in certain startups and i ve seen that one of those who still has been growing,
uh,um and i have seen that uh one of those uh justo uh have been uh growing quite quite a bit,stakes in certain startups and i ve seen that one of those who still has been growing quite a bit,
uh,i have seen that uh one of those uh justo uh have been uh growing quite quite a bit uh any,in certain startups and i ve seen that one of those who still has been growing quite a bit any,
uh,that uh one of those uh justo uh have been uh growing quite quite a bit uh any insights or things,seen that one of those who still has been growing quite a bit any insights or things that you have,
uh,justo uh have been uh growing quite quite a bit uh any insights or things that you have learned on on,those who still has been growing quite a bit any insights or things that you have to learn on the,
uh,know we we we ve been trying to support the uh ven uh with some pension money uh to support those,these states that you can share yes we ve been trying to support with some pension money to support those,
uh,we we ve been trying to support the uh ven uh with some pension money uh to support those suppliers uh,yes we ve been trying to support with some pension money to support those suppliers that are very and i,
uh,to support the uh ven uh with some pension money uh to support those suppliers uh that are very much in,to support with some pension money to support those suppliers that are very and i don t know specifically the,
uh,uh with some pension money uh to support those suppliers uh that are very much in line with us so we,been trying to support with some pension money to support those suppliers that are very and i don t know,
uh,much in line with us so we ll help those uh to enhance our our value proposition and and i i,up looking like in the sense that we we will i m sure adapt our valuable position to that whether,
uh,our value proposition and and i i don t know uh specifically the one you re talking about juan well might,support those suppliers that are very and i don t know specifically the one you re talking about one might,
uh,working not only with technological suppliers but also with with uh normal suppliers where we could help them uh to become,working not only with technological suppliers but also with normal suppliers where we could help them to become larger and,
uh,with with uh normal suppliers where we could help them uh to become larger and in fact we did that with,also with normal suppliers where we could help them to become larger and in fact we did that with a,
uh,think with that knowledge we could be of of great uh uh support to them so this pandemic we also um,think with that knowledge we could be of great support to them so this pandemic we also all the small,
uh,with that knowledge we could be of of great uh uh support to them so this pandemic we also um uh,with that knowledge we could be of great support to them so this pandemic we also all the small vendors,
uh,uh support to them so this pandemic we also um uh we we all the small uh uh vendors we are,knowledge we could be of great support to them so this pandemic we also all the small vendors we are,
uh,pandemic we also um uh we we all the small uh uh vendors we are helping them to pay them very,support to them so this pandemic we also all the small vendors we are helping them to pay them very,
uh,we also um uh we we all the small uh uh vendors we are helping them to pay them very quickly,to them so this pandemic we also all the small vendors we are helping them to pay them very quickly,
uh,problem that this pandemic will cost to them and and uh so that that that those are the the yes but,don t have these cash currents problem that this pandemic will cost to them so those are the yes but,
uh,advantage to us yeah i think on the on the uh justo or justo um investment i mean certainly we re,investments i think on the oxford front they have continued to invest in their new versions of some of the,
uh,mean certainly we re we re trying to to help uh these these new ventures through through our femsa ventures arm,of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of this but we know more about,
uh,these these new ventures through through our femsa ventures arm uh but also learn uh about uh you know things that,bit more to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that,
uh,through through our femsa ventures arm uh but also learn uh about uh you know things that that would help us,to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that this lack,
uh,our femsa ventures arm uh but also learn uh about uh you know things that that would help us in our,add to some of these so on the forefront alan you know i think what we re seeing is you,
uh,know things that that would help us in our own uh value proposition or or the way that we operate and,of cake you know figuring out the right value proposition for the brazilian also it s going to take a,
uh,proposition or or the way that we operate and certainly uh distribution the use of um you know dark dark warehouses,proposition for the brazilian also it s going to take a little bit of time but the size of the,
uh,or dark kitchens dark stores um the handling of perishables uh these are all things that that we would love to,ensure part of the behavior of the competitors and these are major the strength that they have and we ll,
uh,about and this this investment in particular obviously has has uh tur it turned out to be uh an interesting one,about an update on the jv in brazil you know obviously the pandemic throws a little bit of sand into,
uh,obviously has has uh tur it turned out to be uh an interesting one um i mean the the the the,i don t know if you want to add to this one i mean just the point that i think,
uh,a startup that is doing very well and of course uh i know that you stay close to to to these,is an industry that is very well suited for the type of logistics that we do not just in the,
uh,this is so far a very nice success story well uh thanks uh eduardo and juan unk and we will go,growing and this is so far a very nice success story thanks the other one s fine and we will,
uh,so far a very nice success story well uh thanks uh eduardo and juan unk and we will go to alvaro,so far a very nice success story thanks the other one s fine and we will go to alvaro garcia,
uh,garcia of p btg pactual good morning eduardo juan eugenio uh my questions i have two questions sorry i have two,garcia of btg pactual good morning eduardo juan what can you my question has two questions sorry i have two,
uh,the new tax agreement with the mexican government and two uh on m a is it fair to say you re,you re not given a new tax agreement with the mexican government and two on mma fair to say or,
uh,breather and and and integrate a lot of the different uh assets you you bought over the last couple of years,and integrate a lot of the different assets you bought over the last couple of years it doesn t have,
uh,two questions thank you well the heineken the heineken shares uh yes it s a temporary investment we just have to,t have two questions well the heineken shares yes it s a temporary investment we just have to find a,
uh,s a temporary investment we just have to try to uh a way to uh uh deploy that capital in a,shares yes it s a temporary investment we just have to find a way to deploy that capital in a,
uh,we just have to try to uh a way to uh uh deploy that capital in a better way and and,s a temporary investment we just have to find a way to deploy that capital in a better way and,
uh,just have to try to uh a way to uh uh deploy that capital in a better way and and and,just have to find a way to deploy that capital in a better way and it is not as optimal,
uh,as it was in the past as you are referring uh but it s we just have to find the the,as it was in the past as you re referring but we just have to find the right time and,
uh,we just have to find the the the right time uh and and the right path to to uh deploy that,past as you re referring but we just have to find the right time and the right path to start,
uh,right time uh and and the right path to to uh deploy that capital and and and have that um um,at the right time and in the right way is a big part of i think the aspiration that we,
uh,um use of those proceeds um the the second question uh i forgot uh juan would uh uh i i i,but at least during the second quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you i think it s,
uh,those proceeds um the the second question uh i forgot uh juan would uh uh i i i forgot the second,the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those business is,
uh,the the second question uh i forgot uh juan would uh uh i i i forgot the second the the second,for our families thank you very much well i will go to the second one and i think net one,
uh,the second question uh i forgot uh juan would uh uh i i i forgot the second the the second point,for our families thank you very much well i will go to the second one and i think net one,
uh,i think that the answer to that is is yes uh for the most part that s good uh you should,in the mix and that sort of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of,
uh,is yes uh for the most part that s good uh you should expect us to to start integrating uh capturing,what we do so i would say you should expect us to continue to try to grow in that front,
uh,good uh you should expect us to to start integrating uh capturing synergies and kind of uh delivering on the promise,find the right time and the right path to start integrating capturing synergies and kind of delivering on the promise,
uh,to to start integrating uh capturing synergies and kind of uh delivering on the promise of uh of all of these,and the right path to start integrating capturing synergies and kind of delivering on the promise of all of these,
uh,synergies and kind of uh delivering on the promise of uh of all of these investments um i would i would,synergies and kind of delivering on the promise of all of these investments i would say there s probably one,
uh,would i would say there there s probably one one uh exception uh and you know the the jan san platform,the promise of all of these investments i would say there s probably one exception you know the jan platform,
uh,would say there there s probably one one uh exception uh and you know the the jan san platform uh you,promise of all of these investments i would say there s probably one exception you know the jan platform you,
uh,exception uh and you know the the jan san platform uh you know a big part of the of the attractiveness,would say there s probably one exception you know the jan platform you know a big part of the attractiveness,
uh,hard to tell at this point whether there will be uh transactions kind of coming along uh in the coming months,to tell at this point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters,
uh,whether there will be uh transactions kind of coming along uh in the coming months and quarters but if they were,point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters but if they were,
uh,um i think we would be interested in taking looks uh but other than that for the most part and understanding,but if they were i think we would be interested in taking looks our stance is one of as you,
uh,part and understanding that m a is hard to predict uh generally speaking the the our stance is is one of,that are number of stores that should not be open and just generally i think the budget for stores this,
uh,took over the last 18 months yes and alvaro eh uh um uh thinking about the fourth platform that we are,that we took over the last 18 months yes i m thinking about the fourth platform that we re looking,
uh,the last 18 months yes and alvaro eh uh um uh thinking about the fourth platform that we are looking i,that we took over the last 18 months yes i m thinking about the fourth platform that we re looking,
uh,think we already have it so we we the the uh we don t think to open a new vector uh,think we already have so we don t think to open a new vector a different vector for growth was,
uh,uh we don t think to open a new vector uh uh a different vector for growth we the ones we,think we already have so we don t think to open a new vector a different vector for growth was,
uh,we don t think to open a new vector uh uh a different vector for growth we the ones we have,we don t think to open a new vector a different vector for growth was published the proximity health and,
uh,is is already well well established the proximity health um uh and and um uh and now this jan san platform,open a new vector a different vector for growth was published the proximity health and now these young people from,
uh,well established the proximity health um uh and and um uh and now this jan san platform i think we re,a different vector for growth was published the proximity health and now these young people from i think we are,
uh,will take our next question from sergio matsumoto of citi uh yes hi good morning uh thank you for taking my,will take our next question from sergio matsumoto a city yes hi good morning thank you for taking my question,

uh,questions one is i wanted to go back on the uh again portfolio and the the assortment question uh at oxxo,i have two questions one is i want to go back on the portfolio and the assortment question at oxo,
uh,on the uh again portfolio and the the assortment question uh at oxxo uh uh you spoke about how you can,on the portfolio and the assortment question at oxo you spoke about how you can change some of the assortments,
uh,again portfolio and the the assortment question uh at oxxo uh uh you spoke about how you can you know change,portfolio and the assortment question at oxo you spoke about how you can change some of the assortments given the,
uh,portfolio and the the assortment question uh at oxxo uh uh you spoke about how you can you know change some,portfolio and the assortment question at oxo you spoke about how you can change some of the assortments given the,
uh,how you can you know change some of the assortments uh given the the the economic slowdown but uh could you,at oxo you spoke about how you can change some of the assortments given the economic slowdown now could you,
uh,the assortments uh given the the the economic slowdown but uh could you uh explain more on the assortment changes you,can change some of the assortments given the economic slowdown now could you explain more on the assortment changes you,
uh,given the the the economic slowdown but uh could you uh explain more on the assortment changes you can make uh,some of the assortments given the economic slowdown now could you explain more on the assortment changes you can make,
uh,uh explain more on the assortment changes you can make uh in the face of the the the reduced mobility uh,slowdown now could you explain more on the assortment changes you can make in the face of the reduced if,
uh,uh in the face of the the the reduced mobility uh and and especially over the long term if this changes,on the assortment changes you can make in the face of the reduced if this changes the consumer habits like,
uh,the long term if this changes the the consumer habits uh like if if uh the mobility stays low for a,in the face of the reduced if this changes the consumer habits like if the mobility stays low for a,
uh,this changes the the consumer habits uh like if if uh the mobility stays low for a long time that s,the reduced if this changes the consumer habits like if the mobility stays low for a long time that s,
uh,first question and the second question is in brazil logistics uh which are the biggest industries that that uh those businesses,that s the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those,
uh,brazil logistics uh which are the biggest industries that that uh those businesses serve uh sergio uh i i think in,brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those business is served but not really buying the groceries and also,
uh,are the biggest industries that that uh those businesses serve uh sergio uh i i think in in we have better,are the biggest industries that those business is served but not really buying the groceries and also is really the,
uh,biggest industries that that uh those businesses serve uh sergio uh i i think in in we have better abilities and,in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those business is served but not really buying the groceries and,
uh,economic downturn um lack of mobility is it will be uh uh different because really they re also designed to serve,economics time but what we re trying to do is to come up with different offerings to really just to,
uh,downturn um lack of mobility is it will be uh uh different because really they re also designed to serve uh,do is to come up with different offerings to really just to make them demand and here we have our,
uh,uh different because really they re also designed to serve uh people that are on on the go and are on,compared with the quench or some other categories that are more designed to serve people that are on the go,
uh,are on the street we have had in the past uh the daily and replenishment category and and that is the,sales mix effect caused by the bear shortage in may and improved performance of our daily and replenishment categories are,
uh,the daily and replenishment category and and that is the uh groceries we could not really bind the groceries and also,which are the biggest industries that those business is served but not really buying the groceries and also is really,
uh,i think in this pandemic we ve been able to uh to compel uh and the consumer that we have a,been serving i think through this pandemic we ve been able to compel and the consumer that we have a,
uh,this pandemic we ve been able to uh to compel uh and the consumer that we have a uh uh a,this pandemic we ve been able to compel and the consumer that we have a good assortment for that country,
uh,to compel uh and the consumer that we have a uh uh a good assortment of of of for for that,through this pandemic we ve been able to compel and the consumer that we have a good assortment for that,
uh,compel uh and the consumer that we have a uh uh a good assortment of of of for for that uh,compel and the consumer that we have a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that we,
uh,uh a good assortment of of of for for that uh pantry uh uh um uh well to find the product,have a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that we are left out in the country,
uh,good assortment of of of for for that uh pantry uh uh um uh well to find the product you are,and the consumer that we have a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that we are,
uh,assortment of of of for for that uh pantry uh uh um uh well to find the product you are that,to compel and the consumer that we have a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that,
uh,of of for for that uh pantry uh uh um uh well to find the product you are that that you,consumer that we have a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that we are left out,
uh,and finding more they are finding that we have be uh good prices but i think that category um it will,i think by testing that we have a good price but i think that category lack of mobility will be,
uh,we ll have to expand that category compared with the uh um uh uh quench or or or some other categories,mobility will be in place we ll have to expand that category compared with the quench or some other categories,
uh,have to expand that category compared with the uh um uh uh quench or or or some other categories that are,be in place we ll have to expand that category compared with the quench or some other categories that are,
uh,to expand that category compared with the uh um uh uh quench or or or some other categories that are more,in place we ll have to expand that category compared with the quench or some other categories that are more,
uh,on the go but i think that would take more uh the more uh time and and effort than product to,designed to serve people that are on the go but i think that will take more time and effort that,
uh,but i think that would take more uh the more uh time and and effort than product to the economic downturn,but i think that will take more time and effort that which we will expect that it will be for,
uh,to the economic downturn juan yes no i i think uh uh uh i mean on on that front uh it,desperate way and that could disrupt the economic environment in mexico i think what we have for the future is,
uh,the economic downturn juan yes no i i think uh uh uh i mean on on that front uh it it,the economic environment in mexico i think what we have for the future is kind of painful but i think,
uh,economic downturn juan yes no i i think uh uh uh i mean on on that front uh it it it,growth in the future juan yeah and i think i would just following up on what you just said as,
uh,think uh uh uh i mean on on that front uh it it it will be interesting for all of us,think on the oxford front they have continued to invest in their new versions of some of the software as,
uh,to privilege proximity even more right in terms of these uh traditionally kind of supermarket type categories and whether our assortment,mobility in the geography of the desert that translated into soft performance for most of our categories and consumer locations,
uh,supermarket type categories and whether our assortment and our pricing uh is is compelling enough uh which probably we will we,top of mind for the consumer in terms of how good an assortment and how good our pricing is for,
uh,our assortment and our pricing uh is is compelling enough uh which probably we will we will expect that it will,the go but i think that will take more time and effort that which we will expect that it will,
uh,probably we will we will expect that it will be uh for some of these cust consumers to decide to not,which we will expect that it will be for some of these consumers to decide to not as we go,
uh,some of these cust consumers to decide to not just uh buy the you know the cooking oil or the rice,some of these consumers to decide to not as we go along i think and i mentioned earlier the comment,
uh,rice that they forgot or that they run out of uh during you know between trips to the supermarket but that,it s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government i think it,
uh,supermarket but that they will use oxxo as a more uh frequent uh source of this type of products and then,you explain more on the assortment changes you can make in the face of the reduced if this changes the,
uh,that they will use oxxo as a more uh frequent uh source of this type of products and then we will,that sort of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of this but we know,
uh,will make the necessary adjustments as as we go along uh i think on and i mentioned earlier the you know,for some of these consumers to decide to not as we go along i think and i mentioned earlier the,
uh,the you know the the comment about spirits as another uh potential uh category where we uh hopefully uh will become,along i think and i mentioned earlier the comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become,
uh,know the the comment about spirits as another uh potential uh category where we uh hopefully uh will become more kind,think and i mentioned earlier the comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become more kind,
uh,about spirits as another uh potential uh category where we uh hopefully uh will become more kind of top of mind,earlier the comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become more kind of top of mind,
uh,as another uh potential uh category where we uh hopefully uh will become more kind of top of mind for the,comment about spirits as another potential category where we hopefully will become more kind of top of mind for the,
uh,good an assortment and and how good our pricing is uh for for that uh category um i think you also,good an assortment and how good our pricing is for that category i think you also touched on the second,
uh,and how good our pricing is uh for for that uh category um i think you also touched on on the,how good an assortment and how good our pricing is for that category i think you also touched on the,
uh,touched on on the second part of your question on uh the categories for brazil logistics um i think generally as,you also touched on the second part of your question on the categories for brazil logistics i think generally as,
uh,logistics um i think generally as we have been moving uh towards the ltl the less than truckload business uh and,for brazil logistics i think generally as we have been moving towards the ltl the lead and truckload business and,
uh,moving uh towards the ltl the less than truckload business uh and the specialized warehousing uh certainly pharma uh is an,moving towards the ltl the lead and truckload business and specialized workhousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very,
uh,the less than truckload business uh and the specialized warehousing uh certainly pharma uh is an industry that is very well,towards the ltl the lead and truckload business and specialized workhousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very well,
uh,truckload business uh and the specialized warehousing uh certainly pharma uh is an industry that is very well suited um for,ltl the lead and truckload business and specialized workhousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very well suited for,
uh,very well suited um for the for the type of uh logistics that that that we do uh not just in,pharma is an industry that is very well suited for the type of logistics that we do not just in,
uh,the type of uh logistics that that that we do uh not just in the distribution part but also on the,well suited for the type of logistics that we do not just in the distribution part but also on the,
uh,the the company that we acquired a few months ago uh the you know their biggest their biggest category uh actually,if you look at agv the company that we acquired a few months ago you know their it s an,
uh,ago uh the you know their biggest their biggest category uh actually has to do with with health uh certainly a,a bias to the west coast of the u s north american has more of a midwest all the way,
uh,biggest category uh actually has to do with with health uh certainly a big component of of uh animal or veterinary,us to continue to try to grow in that front certainly the health for both a human and veterinary stand,
uh,with with health uh certainly a big component of of uh animal or veterinary health but also human health i think,grow in that front certainly the health for both a human and veterinary stand out as probably one of the,
uh,equation or the relationship between the size of the products uh the weight and the and kind of the volume and,buying for certain categories of the product consumers and this mitigated the blow and made april the least bought month,
uh,volume and the cost um and and the type of uh conditions that they require for the transportation and their storage,of making the numbers match but i i think of the top of our heads that those are questions that,
uh,conditions that they require for the transportation and their storage uh it s an attractive industry it s a profitable industry,ago you know their it s an attractive industry it s a profitable industry and it s a very good,
uh,are cpg products and categories and companies electronics companies but uh certainly the health uh you know for both uh human,you should expect us to continue to try to grow in that front certainly the health for both a human,
uh,categories and companies electronics companies but uh certainly the health uh you know for both uh human and and veterinary uh,us to continue to try to grow in that front certainly the health for both a human and veterinary stand,
uh,but uh certainly the health uh you know for both uh human and and veterinary uh stand stand out as as,continue to try to grow in that front certainly the health for both a human and veterinary stand out as,
uh,uh you know for both uh human and and veterinary uh stand stand out as as as uh probably one of,to grow in that front certainly the health for both a human and veterinary stand out as probably one of,

uh,yesterday at walmex uh conference call they may show uh uh some risks uh with respect to the introduction of the,your muscle thank you i mean i just wrote that question you know the concept or the notion of the,
uh,uh conference call they may show uh uh some risks uh with respect to the introduction of the new labeling uh,we will go back to a follow up from gustavo olivera of ubs the impact of those new labeling rules,
uh,uh with respect to the introduction of the new labeling uh regulation rules that will start already in october uh could,of those new labeling rules in your oxford business perhaps during the transition time now as it implemented in october,
uh,labeling uh regulation rules that will start already in october uh could you please uh help us to understand what could,to solve and what we wouldn t like to have to solve it in a desperate way and that could,
uh,that will start already in october uh could you please uh help us to understand what could be the impact of,that really i mean also really lives by the people on the go and moving to understand and adapt to,
uh,us to understand what could be the impact of those uh new labeling rules uh in your in your oxxo business,to a follow up from gustavo olivera of ubs the impact of those new labeling rules in your oxford business,
uh,could be the impact of those uh new labeling rules uh in your in your oxxo business perhaps during the transition,from gustavo olivera of ubs the impact of those new labeling rules in your oxford business perhaps during the transition,
uh,in your oxxo business perhaps during the transition time now uh as as as it s implemented in october and perhaps,new labeling rules in your oxford business perhaps during the transition time now as it implemented in october and perhaps,
uh,push for for sales growth we we think that the uh sometimes too much information for the consumer and and and,push for sales growth we think that sometimes too much information much information for the consumer and it seems like,
uh,the consumer and and and and and it seems like uh what i ve been learning i think it s very,too much information much information for the consumer and it seems like what i ve been learning i think the,
uh,so the consumer can do the better decision for the uh their their uh i don t know for their health,what i ve been learning i think the consumers so the consumer can do the better decision for their health,
uh,can do the better decision for the uh their their uh i don t know for their health and and and,can do the better decision for their health and nutrition so much information that he doesn t want to have,
uh,nutrition and everything sometimes if the if the if the uh labeling goes a bit too far the consumer might be,shift in consumer dynamics in the first part of the quarter most of the consumer demand weakness came from mobility,
uh,far the consumer might be blocking some of some of uh so so much information that he doesn t want to,consumer can do the better decision for their health and nutrition so much information that he doesn t want to,
uh,so so much information that he doesn t want to uh uh uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by,for their health and nutrition so much information that he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by,
uh,so much information that he doesn t want to uh uh uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by this,so much information that he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t,
uh,much information that he doesn t want to uh uh uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by this uh,much information that he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t know,
uh,information that he doesn t want to uh uh uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by this uh uh,information that he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t know really,
uh,want to uh uh uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by this uh uh uh labeling we don t,so much information that he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t,
uh,uh uh he he s just uh overloaded by this uh uh uh labeling we don t know really where we,he doesn t want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t know really where we,
uh,uh he he s just uh overloaded by this uh uh uh labeling we don t know really where we would,have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t know really where we live then and i think,
uh,he he s just uh overloaded by this uh uh uh labeling we don t know really where we would stand,want to have he s just overloaded by these savings we don t know really where we live then and,
uh,but but currently we have been working very closely with uh with the with the our suppliers and i think we,i think that currently we are really working very closely with our suppliers and i think we ll be in,
uh,in a very good position to adapt to this new uh environment we don t see major derails uh uh ha,in a very good position to adapt to this new environment we don t see major these raises happening i,
uh,this new uh environment we don t see major derails uh uh ha happening um i don t know you want,adapt to this new environment we don t see major these raises happening i don t know if you want,
uh,new uh environment we don t see major derails uh uh ha happening um i don t know you want to,to this new environment we don t see major these raises happening i don t know if you want to,
uh,um i don t know you want to add to uh to this one i mean uh just just the point,these raises happening i don t know if you want to add to this one i mean just the point,
uh,want to add to uh to this one i mean uh just just the point that i think on on on,want to add to this one i mean just the point that i think on beverages certainly on the copefram,
uh,consumer has been well informed for many years now about uh you know calorie count and that sort of thing and,generally the consumer has been well informed for many years now about the calorie count and that sort of thing,
uh,the percentage of the of the portfolio that has reduced uh or no calories at all um and so i think,a while increasing the percentage of the portfolio that has reduced or no calories at all and so i think,
uh,know the costs and the kind of the the operating uh conundrums of you know changing labels or adjusting your packaging,involve more the costs and the operating conundrums sort of thing but not so much in terms of the incremental,
uh,consumer will receive there are there are other categories where uh maybe the the consumer has not been as as as,consumer will receive there are other categories where maybe the consumer has not been as exposed to nutritional i think,
uh,those there there there will be a period of adaptation uh but to eduardo s point uh you know i think,this point whether there will be transactions kind of coming along in the coming months and quarters but if they,
uh,a period of adaptation uh but to eduardo s point uh you know i think also is is is it s,to add to some of these so on the forefront alan you know i think what we re seeing is,
uh,the the the flexibility and the the the level of uh dialogue and cooperation with suppliers uh leads i think to,live then and i think that currently we are really working very closely with our suppliers and i think we,
uh,the the level of uh dialogue and cooperation with suppliers uh leads i think to to what should be a relatively,help them to become larger and in fact we did that with a great supplier that we had with new,
uh,be a relatively smooth transition when this eventually becomes a uh uh a fact uh during this transition uh juan and,a big part of the attractiveness of that business involves a growth through acquisitions and eventually integration of integration and,
uh,a relatively smooth transition when this eventually becomes a uh uh a fact uh during this transition uh juan and eduardo,the strength that they have and we ll be happy about it and the other hand in the jantan business,
uh,transition when this eventually becomes a uh uh a fact uh during this transition uh juan and eduardo uh do you,and answer session will begin at this time if you d like to ask a question during this time simply,
uh,becomes a uh uh a fact uh during this transition uh juan and eduardo uh do you foresee uh um the,to hit the ones that have lack of beer during these initial periods of their downturn great thank you question,
uh,a fact uh during this transition uh juan and eduardo uh do you foresee uh um the risk of a uh,hi everyone thanks for the space for questions share any color on what you re seeing in terms of the,
uh,this transition uh juan and eduardo uh do you foresee uh um the risk of a uh a more aggressive markdown,the space for questions share any color on what you re seeing in terms of the ship in mix more,
uh,uh do you foresee uh um the risk of a uh a more aggressive markdown just to get rid of the,making your last payments on it do you know what the tenure of this agreement is going forward or are,
uh,old labeling and befo or or suppliers are going to uh assume the cost um you know of of that operation,as we ve said before this is not going to be a piece of cake you know figuring out the,
uh,results no but i i i think if we we uh i ne but i never uh the turnover of inventory,could impact your 4q results or perhaps part of your 3q results no but i think the turnover of inventory,
uh,think if we we uh i ne but i never uh the turnover of inventory in in in in oxxo goes,your 4q results or perhaps part of your 3q results no but i think the turnover of inventory also goes,
uh,will then we ll continue to make some more money uh uh yes i i i think it ll be yeah,will be some opportunities to make some money yes i think it will be probably an alternative i don t,
uh,then we ll continue to make some more money uh uh yes i i i think it ll be yeah probably,goes very fast and there will be some opportunities to make some money yes i think it will be probably,
uh,yes i i i think it ll be yeah probably uh uh an alternative i don t know if juan no,to make some money yes i think it will be probably an alternative i don t know if one no,
uh,i i i think it ll be yeah probably uh uh an alternative i don t know if juan no i,make some money yes i think it will be probably an alternative i don t know if one no i,
uh,know if juan no i i agree with you that uh our inventory levels and uh you know tend to be,know if one no i agree with you that our inventory levels and you know tend to be small and,
uh,i agree with you that uh our inventory levels and uh you know tend to be small and and there the,i agree with you that our inventory levels and you know tend to be small and the turnover is fast,

uh,the spanish gas system has worked and continues to work uh normally despite the adverse conditions without incidents neither rely neither,let me say that the spanish gas system has worked and continues is also at its historical record nearly 12,
uh,months of last year 2019 also in spain we have uh unloaded a total of 126 lng ships that is an,etc etc is the consumption of last year though its weight in the total of the industrial demand is small,
uh,3 million euros which is an increase of 9 4 uh compared to the first six months of 2019 mainly this,provided in the presentation this resistance has been shown in the results obtained in the first 6 months of this,
uh,do maintain a solid financial structure without um significant maturity uh debts debts maturity until 22 and with more than 80,we do maintain a solid financial structure without significant and with more than 80 of our debt at fixed rate,
uh,paid in 2019 and i will pause on this pol uh on this point later foreign regarding the changes in demand,to 2024 we will have more visibility on this topic are we going to invest more in hydrogen as a,
uh,data current situation and future projects in the case of uh tap the project is progressing as planned and this has,maybe the current situation shows that there are projects that compete that won t evolve so we ve got good,
uh,and storage strategy in the second semester of last year uh last week the ecologic transition ministry and demographic challenge ministry,etc is the consumption of last year though its weight in the total of the industrial demand is small well,
uh,i m not going to repeat the figures that we uh provide you with the results presentation in february but enagas,i m not going to repeat the figures that we provide you with the results presentation plan to reduce co2,
uh,this and also we will compliment that role with um uh amongst other actors and everything that has to do with,the main risk that all prices stay low and that growth just doesn t come through and and within that,
uh,we will have to adapt of course to the instructions uh issued by the government and the commission or the parliament,renewable gases projects we re convinced about that and in the first documents issued by the european commission they state,
uh,i do believe that our role as a tso as uh the the role of other tsos will change in a,answer i do believe that our role as a tso as the role of other tsos will change in a,
uh,tasks to undertake second question i ve got the cf uh cfo he s wearing glasses reading glasses and his mask,undertake second question i ve got the cfo he s wearing glasses reading glasses and his mask and he s,
uh,impact is going to be positive 16 2 million which uh which is explained by the fact of changing uh the,difference and the second half the impact is going to be positive 16 2 65 million multiplied by exchange rate,
uh,which uh which is explained by the fact of changing uh the results and moving from 3 8 to 53 4,in which we explained how we are facing the from the covid 19 pandemic the conclusions are clear we ve,
uh,bdi of 300 million financial expenses expenses of one 181 uh million and this accounts for 65 million multiplied by exchange,and the second half the impact is going to be positive 16 2 65 million multiplied by exchange rate is,
uh,more questions yes let s um move now to the uh questions in english this question will come from harry wyburd,if there yes let s move now to the questions in english the question will come from harry wehblord of,

uh,new regulation the rcs in future years out to 2026 uh was actually based on the rcs uh this year if,under the new regulation the rcs in future years out to 2026 was actually based on the rcs this year,
uh,out to 2026 uh was actually based on the rcs uh this year if i ve understood correctly so i wondered,out to 2026 was actually based on the rcs this year so if i ve understood correctly so i wanted,
uh,rcs was lower this year that that would have a uh a knock on effects on future years as well uh,rts was lower this year that that would have a knock on effect or have i misunderstood something there and,
uh,uh a knock on effects on future years as well uh or have i misunderstood something uh there and then the,have a knock on effect or have i misunderstood something there and then second question just on your affiliates overall,
uh,future years as well uh or have i misunderstood something uh there and then the second question just on on your,that would have a knock on effect or have i misunderstood something there and then second question just on your,
uh,of how much is in dollars and and then thirdly uh i m afraid it s a it s an obligatory,to get a reminder of how much is in dollars and then thirdly i m afraid it s an obligatory,
uh,i m afraid it s a it s an obligatory uh hydrogen question but a a specific one i think in,dollars and then thirdly i m afraid it s an obligatory hydrogen question but a specific one i think in,
uh,i think in the in the um hydrogen backbone report uh you and the your tso colleagues quantified the total capex,specific one i think in the in the hydrogen backbone report you and your tso colleagues quantified the total capex,
uh,and the your tso colleagues quantified the total capex spend uh at at a midpoint of about 40 billion euros up,backbone report you and your tso colleagues quantified the total capex spend at a midpoint of about 40 billion you,
uh,correctly if if i just eyeball the map that you uh published in the in the slides uh today i think,2040 if i remember correctly if i just eyeball the map that you published in the slides today i think,
uh,map that you uh published in the in the slides uh today i think is on slide 26 it looks like,just eyeball the map that you published in the slides today i think is on slide 26 it looks like,
uh,two first question the cfo will give you a detailed uh answer thank you mr president concerning rcs the merged impact,that s your first question the cfo will give you a detailed answer thank you mr president concerning rcs the,
uh,annum and concerning the contribution of affiliates for the equivalent uh 90 25 is in dollars because we are talking about,p l account at the bottom affiliates for the equivalent 90 25 is in dollars because we are talking about,
uh,and they are all dollarized as you mentioned so the uh percentage of the contribution of dollars to the p l,the second half of the year we need to indicate that the contribution of salt grass is different so the,
uh,the document we are talking about now is a first uh reflection is a draft it s not uh an investment,europe the document we are talking about now is a first reflection is a draft it s not an investment,
uh,a first uh reflection is a draft it s not uh an investment detailed plan but from a technic from a,a first reflection is a draft it s not an investment detail plan but from a have different technical standards,
uh,be sorted out in terms of the blending so the uh percentage of hydrogen can be used in one uh grid,in spain or in france or in italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural a certain,
uh,the uh percentage of hydrogen can be used in one uh grid m mixed with lng this is the first phase,france or in italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural a certain amount of time there,
uh,phase the different countries historically have different technical standards some uh strictly technical questions are related to some part of the,plan but from a have different technical standards some strictly technical questions are related will be used and at this,
uh,nor have them be they ve been included in the uh national road maps we have a general overview of how,have been discussed nor have they been included in the national road maps we have a general overview of how,
uh,brand from deutsche bank please go ahead alright good morning uh thanks for taking my questions i i had a couple,will come from james brand from deutsche bank please go ahead hi good morning thanks for taking my questions guidance,
uh,year which i think assuming i heard the numbers correctly uh came came down to 56 to 57 million of pre,this year which i think is assuming i had the numbers correctly came down to 56 to 57 million of,
uh,pre ppa net income i was wondering whether you could uh give some expectations for the next year just so we,each one maybe with some one of that might not have been expected at the start of the year you,
uh,through in h2 might look in in a more normal uh year and then the second question is i i was,or have i misunderstood something there and then second question just on your affiliates overall i just wanted to see,
uh,basins that that you re in that looked broadly that uh volumes had come down a bit but overall woods would,income it looked broadly that volumes had come down a bit but overall would recover a little bit particularly in,
uh,and you see contracting pressure and i was within that uh is there a particular point of oil prices that would,t come through and and within that is there a particular point of oil prices that would start to make,
uh,they stayed at 40 or maybe they have to drop uh more but um appreciate those a few sub questions within,stayed up 40 or maybe they have to drop more but i appreciate there was a few sub questions within,

uh,to the 440 million to 4 year on year growth uh but really you ve done 9 in h1 maybe with,to the 440 million to 4 year on year growth but really give the 9 in each one maybe with,
uh,in the transport and the natural gas mix i think uh the documents are talking a potential 10 to to 20,to this transport and storage of natural gas and we will start to have well i ve already told you,
uh,to be able to cope with um with the chemical uh and physical um implications of that level of hydrogen in,the green crane project with other companies especially snam which aims at developing a hydrogen corridor from southern europe to,
uh,than expected but the facing the entire devolution of the uh market the uh forecast for the year is 440 and,are at the equator of the year let me briefly remind you the objectives for the year i will also,
uh,the facing the entire devolution of the uh market the uh forecast for the year is 440 and we are trusting,as we are at the equator of the year let me briefly remind you the objectives for the year i,
uh,for the generation of this hydrogen we are far from uh being real now and we need to implement this in,for the generation of this hydrogen implement this in our unit and we are implementing studying that and if we,
uh,if we think about 2035 2040 having 100 percent hydrogen uh network we will have some of the gas the pipelines,that and if we we think about 2035 2040 having a 100 hydrogen network we will have some of the,
uh,um just most of my questions have been answered but uh i just wanted to come back on hydrogen you said,hello just most of my questions have been answered but i just wanted to come back on daydrojan you said,
uh,when there will be an off taker for your hydrogen uh potential so i wonder can you give us an idea,you said something that i found extremely interesting that you will start i wonder can you give us an idea,
uh,fully regulated will have to be contracted before you will uh commit on investment um then you think this would be,having spent that much on the network to enable it for hydrogen is the biggest investment then if it does,
uh,italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the uh natural gas for a certain amount of time there technically,italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural a certain amount of time there technically speaking we,
uh,project in which the ultimate off taker will be a uh a uh a company transporting passengers and that is a,project in which the where we are involved of course the ministry is involved and the ministry has asked our,
uh,which the ultimate off taker will be a uh a uh a company transporting passengers and that is a clear example,will be the regulators the ones that will say yes i want that in spain or in france or in,
uh,grid or the french or the italian grid part of uh of hydrogen as blended with natural gas to among other,been said that the use or more or less hydrogen blended with natural gas which is something that can be,
uh,that we ve been able to reply to your questions uh we do want to thank you for the interest on,think that we ve been able to reply to your questions we do want to thank you for the interest,

uh,to let s say three or 4 in the past uh these are different times but how should we think about,to let s say three or four percent in the these are different times but how should we think about,
uh,just give us um a general sense you you mention uh you there are certain costs your you can control and,just give us a general sense you mentioned there are certain costs you can control and you are controlling you,
uh,you look i mean i did not set i mean uh and if you take a look at our numbers basically,mentioned there are certain costs you can control and you are controlling you take a look at our numbers basically,

uh,decisions in terms of closing down a big number of uh of um branches or anything like that i think we,take i mean rough decisions in terms of closing down a big number of branches or anything like that we,
uh,with evolution of the economy what should happen there so uh but we re going to be very strict if you,with the evolution of the economy what should happen there but we re going to be very strict if you,
uh,strict if you have seen the growth of the past uh four or five years in terms of branches we actually,strict if you have seen the growth of the post four or five years in terms of branches we actually,
uh,have decreased the number of total branches we have just uh we have been very intelligent in the way we have,have decreased the number of total branches we have just we have been very intelligent in the way we have,
uh,we have managed that what we have done is upgraded uh the current and the most important branches which we are,we have managed that what we have done is upgraded the current and the most important branches which we are,
uh,most important branches which we are going to basically be uh taking a little bit more time than the time that,most important branches which we are going than the time that we were thinking of upgrading all the branches that,
uh,a little bit more time than the time that we uh were thinking of of um upgrading all the branches that,most important branches which we are going than the time that we were thinking of upgrading all the branches that,
uh,we re doing we re going to basically rationalize all uh all uh all expending and do it on where the,standard so this is actually what we re doing basically rationalize all the spending and do it on where the,
uh,doing we re going to basically rationalize all uh all uh all expending and do it on where the most important,this is actually what we re doing basically rationalize all the spending and do it on where the most important,
uh,sense we re going to be very concentrated on that uh we also believe that i mean given that we have,bank so in that sense we re going to be very concentrated on that of a huge amount of people,
uh,have a huge amount of people basically working from home uh you basically get to understand just actually how really how,on that of a huge amount of people basically working from home you basically get to understand exactly how much,
uh,just actually how really how much people do you need uh what can you rationalize et cetera so what you re,exactly how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you re going to see,
uh,from us is that we re going to be very uh responsible in the way we manage that and uh concentrate,to see from us is that we re going to be very responsible in the way we manage that and,

uh,all the other countries you know for example the onboarding uh for smes we are using the one that is being,all the other countries for example the onboarding for smes we are using the one that is being developed in,
uh,going to help us out basically in reducing our cost uh for the the infrastructure that we re developing and we,to help us out basically in reducing our cost for of the digital infrastructure that we re developing and we,
uh,going to see that i mean in the cost of uh basically developing things and it s going to come down,you re gonna see that i mean the cost of basically developing things and it s going to come down,
uh,we re doing it together with the rest of our uh um sister banks so so so those t great thank,we re doing it together with the rest of our mc server so thank you very much for implementing at,
uh,further um complications in the next couple of quarters given uh falling grades and weak uh loan demands and um mixed,that you expect further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed,
uh,next couple of quarters given uh falling grades and weak uh loan demands and um mixed deterioration um as as you,further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you,
uh,um mixed deterioration um as as you look at 2021 uh in the context of what you said on n not,weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you look at 2021 in the context of what you said on not,
uh,and and to to what extent that can be offset uh elsewhere in the pml and and my second question is,of nii compression and to what extent that can be offset elsewhere in the pml and my second question is,
uh,but but evidently the the the size of your reserves uh have a relationship to the size of your logbook the,it but evidently the size of your reserves have a relationship to the size of your loan book the size,
uh,all i mean um if you have seen i mean uh we have decreased quite a lot our exposure unfortunately to,you have so there is something that you have to do in order to be able to access the rate,
uh,lot our exposure unfortunately to smes given the lack of uh warranties from the government from nafinsa okay so uh the,will ask them to answer the first part and then i will have the government from nafinza okay so the,
uh,of uh warranties from the government from nafinsa okay so uh the portfolio has dropped almost 10 so in that sense,then i will have the government from nafinza okay so the portfolio has dropped almost 10 so in that sense,
uh,the portfolio has dropped almost 10 so in that sense uh that basically is a high yield portfolio which um is,okay so the portfolio has dropped almost 10 so in that sense that basically is a high portfolio it s,
uh,answer your second part of the question in terms of uh the amount of uh the amount of reserves that we,this basically goes to answer your second part of the question in terms of the amount of research that we,
uh,of the question in terms of uh the amount of uh the amount of reserves that we have done uh then,of the question in terms of the amount of research that we have done that for example consumer credit and,
uh,of uh the amount of reserves that we have done uh then you see that uh also we see that for,answer your second part of the question in terms of the amount of research that we have done that for,
uh,reserves that we have done uh then you see that uh also we see that for example consumer credit and uh,research that we have done that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so,
uh,uh also we see that for example consumer credit and uh consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the,that we have done that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are going to decrease as well so the,
uh,looking at the the risk that we are taking and uh we are looking very closely at the ratings of those,basically looking at the risk that we are taking and we are looking very closely at the weightings of those,
uh,towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we uh which we believe i mean there is a sector still,towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we believe i mean there is a sector still of growth,
uh,which we believe i mean there is a sector still uh of growth i mean as you know there is a,mortgages which we believe i mean there is a sector still of growth i mean as you know there is,
uh,a part of the population that can afford a mortgage uh mortgages penetration in mexico was quite low versus the rest,part of the population that can afford a mortgage mortgage penetration in mexico is quite low versus arrest and also,
uh,maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be uh also lending in that in the in that part i,penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be also lending in that part i,
uh,mean and auto loans also we have seen some interesting uh development there with very cautious approach to it so in,mean and auto loans also we have seen some interesting developments there with very cautious approach to it so in,
uh,what you were asking in terms of um the reserves uh we maybe we ve actually been doing reserves accordingly wh,what you were asking in terms of the reserves we actually been doing reserves price about it hopefully it continues,
uh,reserves accordingly wh to what we believe we are doing uh in terms of uh uh how the portfolio is uh,them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much,
uh,what we believe we are doing uh in terms of uh uh how the portfolio is uh is uh behaving at,that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going to be much more important or that,
uh,we believe we are doing uh in terms of uh uh how the portfolio is uh is uh behaving at this,the pending holiday start and we see the we will see how the performance of the portfolio is and then,
uh,uh in terms of uh uh how the portfolio is uh is uh behaving at this point what i can tell,product so that s why the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well behaving in a nice in a nice,
uh,terms of uh uh how the portfolio is uh is uh behaving at this point what i can tell you is,that s why the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well behaving in a nice in a nice in a,
uh,to turn actually i m quite surprised about it hopefully uh it continues that way but in that sense we are,reserves we actually been doing reserves price about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense we are,
uh,in that sense we are basically being in my opinion uh being very responsible in the amount of uh of reserves,that sense we are basically being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of research that we are,
uh,my opinion uh being very responsible in the amount of uh of reserves that we are making at this point also,being in my opinion being very responsible in the amount of research that we are making at this point also,
uh,at this point also we have done a tremendous job uh with the data uh hopes that we have in reviewing,making at this point also we have done a tremendous job with the data hopes that we have in reviewing,
uh,we have done a tremendous job uh with the data uh hopes that we have in reviewing um the portfolio on,point also we have done a tremendous job with the data hopes that we have in reviewing the portfolio on,
uh,on each particular situation and in some of these portfolios uh even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking,in each particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking,
uh,we are already talking to clients and discussing the way uh uh that that we could get paid on those particular,holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get paid on those particular,
uh,are already talking to clients and discussing the way uh uh that that we could get paid on those particular situations,are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get paid on those particular situations because what,
uh,have seen 55 of our branches have been turned into uh collecting branches i mean uh to basically this uh uh,have seen 55 of our branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we re dedicating,
uh,branches have been turned into uh collecting branches i mean uh to basically this uh uh we re dedicating our executives,branches have been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we re dedicating our executives to collect and,
uh,into uh collecting branches i mean uh to basically this uh uh we re dedicating our executives to collect we have,been turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we re dedicating our executives to collect and we have,
uh,uh collecting branches i mean uh to basically this uh uh we re dedicating our executives to collect we have divided,turned into collecting branches i mean to basically this we re dedicating our executives to collect and we have divided,
uh,we re very well prepared although i mean or nevertheless uh is always i mean a lot of uncertainty in what,so in that sense i really we re very well prepared absolutely absolutely i would like to compliment on what,
uh,to go overboard and we believe it s the right uh the right approach is the one that we have made,we believe is that whoever gets paid first is the one that is going to get paid so we are,
uh,jorge long time no speak um eh in terms of uh eh nims you know eh definitely you know as we,talking to you jorge a long time no speak in terms of names you know differently you know as we,
uh,as we laid out in the presentation we see significant uh pressures and let me just give you some background information,as we laid out in the presentation we see significant pressures and let me just give you some background information,
uh,just in this quarter eh the average of the reference uh reference rate came down 123 basis points that s the,you see in this quarter i think is probably the most severe that we re going to see in a,
uh,and this was the second and third quarter of 2016 uh i think that eh the the number that that we,need to help you know the big spike in the quarter in the third quarter or do you think that,
uh,significantly you know and those are you know lower margin uh eh assets relative to the the the loan portfolio just,are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the loan portfolio,
uh,the loan portfolio just to you know share with you uh we ve bought in this account you know both divestment,a or you might question you know whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let,
uh,of 2020 and eh for next year i think that uh you know having said that there s still a lot,our investment securities portfolio so next year i think that you know having said that there s still a lot,
uh,sense that we don t target inaudible that that s uh resulting number and also you know when you eh make,of provisions that we have are in line with the expected losses that we estimate you know you might have,
uh,to inaudible the first quarter this year they had 140 uh in this in the second quarter they did as we,orte in the first quarter of this year they had 140 you know the level of provisions that we have,
uh,s why you know they re their increased to 200 uh i m probably just elaborating elaborating eh the more on,of all you know the mpls that increase that we see in the second quarter are associated with those clients,
uh,elaborating elaborating eh the more on what information you know uh the letter of provisions that we have are in line,of this year they had 140 you know the level of provisions that we have are in line with the,
uh,you assume okay eh eh so so there should be uh direct correlation between expected losses and provisions and the provisions,you assume and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with information that we have are you,
uh,putting forward we think that with information that we have uh are quite strong to cover you know expected losses if,putting forward we think that with information that we have are you know quite strong to cover you know expected,
uh,know a shock with the variables that we re seeing uh lately and they estimated how much uh npl ratios rate,know a shock with the variables of loans by type of bank you get to see you know this is,
uh,we re seeing uh lately and they estimated how much uh npl ratios rate for the entire banking system um for,expecting right now definitely we will and what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for,
uh,with with provision okay thank you thank hector for the uh detailed responses we will take the next question it comes,that each bank would provision okay thank you for the detailed responses we will take the next question it comes,
uh,go ahead hi good morning hector thanks for the opportunity uh my first question is a follow up on the preventive,good morning hector i am the dear thanks for the my first question is a follow up on the preventive,
uh,to the relief program and then my second question is uh a different one because we would like to know if,offset elsewhere in the pml and my second question is on the coverage ratio and i know that banks normally,
uh,there is a sector that is concerning you and finally uh my my last question is um competition in mortgage loans,a sector that is concerning you my last question is on competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks,
uh,my my last question is um competition in mortgage loans uh we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates uh,you my last question is on competition in mortgage loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of,
uh,uh we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates uh of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how,loans we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates of mortgages in light of the lower rates so how,
uh,your strategy to attract more more mortgage clients and how uh competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto,been your strategy to attract more judge clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto,
uh,competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto uh let me let me start and then maybe i will,clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you ernesto let me start and then divya will,
uh,times to my cro and he basically tells me that uh when i ask you and ask him the same question,times to my cro and he basically tells me that when i asked you and you re asking me at,
uh,we ll take you re going to see our numbers uh right as uh i mean we re going to take,ll take i mean you re going to see our numbers right as i mean we re going to take,
uh,you re going to see our numbers uh right as uh i mean we re going to take the provisions as,mean you re going to see our numbers right as i mean we re going to take the provisions as,
uh,to take the provisions as soon as they come if uh needed okay and the second point in mexico yes and,take the provisions as soon as they come if needed okay and our second point in our mexico yes and,
uh,point in mexico yes and and inaudible we do have uh exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing,our mexico yes and so yes we do have exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too,
uh,not very significant versus the size of the bank and uh we have loans or provisions already on some inaudible to,s not very significant versus the size of the bank and we have done some provisions already on some of,
uh,basically in those structure and process as of now and uh we see that the company can recover uh fairly i,significant we are basically in the restructuring process as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly,
uh,now and uh we see that the company can recover uh fairly i mean i don t see that inaudible in,as of now and we see that the company can recover fairly i mean i don t see that i,
uh,mortgage loans um it s quite important what we do uh uh we cannot important differentiation in terms of how we,and beverage it s quite important what we do we have an important differentiation in terms of how we do,
uh,loans um it s quite important what we do uh uh we cannot important differentiation in terms of how we do,it s quite important what we do we have an important differentiation in terms of how we do mortgages versus,
uh,in the market but in order to get the rate uh rate available in the market which is seven points 75,in the market but in order to get the rate best which is 7 75 for a 15 year mortgage,
uh,client and that is above 9 as a rate and uh and that s for a difficult different type of client,completely transparent to the client above 9 that s the rate and that s for a different type of client,
uh,have a chinese menu for every different type of inaudible uh what we do and and for example inaudible for a,have a chinese menu for every type of different client who would like to access what we do and for,
uh,there are some of these clients are very good and uh have very good credit quality and uh that s what,us that is basically clients with a lower ticket we ve had very good credit quality and that s what,
uh,very good and uh have very good credit quality and uh that s what we decided to compete in that sector,ve had very good credit quality and that s what we decided to compete in that sector i don t,
uh,sure hector um eh regarding your first first question ernesto uh it was as previously mentioned uniting inaudible on the you,and please be a compliment sure hector regarding your first question ernesto as i previously mentioned and i somewhere around,
uh,back their loans we think that eventually if there s uh you know a u type recovery and gdp contracting somewhere,the rest of the year now do we think that there s going to be a v type recovery in,
uh,the breakdown that i have right now it s more uh the one that is used more for regulatory purposes and,the breakdown that that i have right now it s more the one that cnbb uses more for regulatory purposes,
uh,it comes from brian unk from citibank please go ahead uh everyone thank you for the opportunity to ask question before,it comes from brian flores from citibank please go ahead hi good morning thank you for the opportunity to ask,
uh,right 40 thank you and and now for my question uh you know inaudible quality and you mentioned inaudible portfolio has,might have a you know a or you might question you know whether we you know this is enough or,
uh,you mentioned inaudible portfolio has a large degree of inaudible uh my question is could you inaudible and the inaudible what,you mentioned smd portfolio has a large degree of guarantee by everything my question is in great guys could you,
uh,products eh most impacted you know when you look at uh you know the different types of loans that clients have,products most impacted you don t you know you continue paying you know if there s any just one loan,
uh,comes from tito labarta from goldman sachs hi good morning uh thank you for the call and taking the questions um,them at this time hi good morning thank you for the call and taking the questions one question on the,
uh,put in liquidation but eh by the national banking commission uh inaudible crisis inaudible being unable to operate so eventually one,put into liquidation by the national banking commission this has become a very long crisis with some segments of the,
uh,so eventually one would imagine inaudible might get into trouble uh are you taking special precautions uh in regard to any,operate so eventually one would imagine that some institutions might get into trouble are you taking special precautions in regard,
uh,might get into trouble uh are you taking special precautions uh in regard to any sectors of the financial system and,some institutions might get into trouble are you taking special precautions in regard to any factors of financial system and,
uh,cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what uh their position is and their situation um and we re,cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what their position is and their situation as the crisis continues,
uh,crisis continues to to to evolve so in that sense uh we are very close in uh to that particular sector,their situation as the crisis continues to evolve so in that sense we are very close to that particular sector,
uh,so in that sense uh we are very close in uh to that particular sector we don t have i mean,to evolve so in that sense we are very close to that particular sector we don t have i mean,
uh,are not a big lender to the sector i mean uh uh i can tell you that um if you uh,mean we are not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if they re,
uh,not a big lender to the sector i mean uh uh i can tell you that um if you uh they,not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if they re not in the,
uh,uh uh i can tell you that um if you uh they re not in the inaudible ten most important clients,you that if they re not in the as we hear what they know they re the most important clients,
uh,but we are very concern taking a look and monitoring uh them all the time okay hopefully the crisis is shorter,support the backbone and we are taking a look and we re doing a deep dive in terms of all,
uh,think microfinance is a sector that we need to be uh very close monitoring we don t have to we don,think microfinance is a sector that we need to be around the base of the pyramid so unfortunately that s,
uh,the people that suffer the most are the ones that uh are on the are on the base of the pyramid,them up on them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are going,
uh,hi alonzo um you know there are p several factors uh regarding liquidity pay pay i think that the the most,hi alonso there are several factors regarding liquidity ratio and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the,
uh,liquidity pay pay i think that the the most um uh relevant is our you know how we fund a a,the so i think that it do not surprise us you know we mentioned that given this deterioration of economic,
uh,the inaudible that as mentioned was one of the strongest uh numbers that we have reported since we became a listed,the exposure that we have with aeromexico and that s close to 45 of the exposure that we have that,
uh,opinion that s the most inaudible and fundamental way of uh looking at it then um as you rightly mentioned the,that if you look at it it s probably the one let s say risk that could materialize in the,
uh,as you rightly mentioned the um the debt issuance is uh you know contributed significantly to the increase of our uh,a or you might question you know whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let,
uh,uh you know contributed significantly to the increase of our uh uh liquidity coverage ratio and we are monitoring you know,liquidity thank you very much hi alonso there are several factors regarding liquidity ratio and we are monitoring you know,
uh,you know contributed significantly to the increase of our uh uh liquidity coverage ratio and we are monitoring you know any,thank you very much hi alonso there are several factors regarding liquidity ratio and we are monitoring you know any,
uh,are monitoring you know any p p potential use of uh the committed lines of credit that we have with our,and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our,
uh,if you look at it it s probably the one uh uh let s say risk that could materialize in in,if you look at it it s probably the one let s say risk that could materialize in the short,
uh,you look at it it s probably the one uh uh let s say risk that could materialize in in in,you look at it it s probably the one let s say risk that could materialize in the short term,
uh,pay you know every single committed line of credit that uh that we have but that that s the one the,every single committed line of credit that we have that we re not seeing that and i think that the,
uh,have but that that s the one the most relevant uh driver in terms of consumption of uh liquidity the other,and medium sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain the liquidity of their,
uh,the most relevant uh driver in terms of consumption of uh liquidity the other types of uh you know events that,probably the most severe numbers in terms of nimp are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there,
uh,terms of consumption of uh liquidity the other types of uh you know events that could impact our liquidity you know,on the other hand you know the true impact that it has had in our asset quality no no it,
uh,more gradual you know and those could be you know uh a contraction in deposits that we re not seeing that,that you know the first of all you know the mpls that increase that we see in the second quarter,
uh,seeing that um and i think that the bank has uh managed um quite practically you know per liquidity to be,seeing that and i think that the bank has managed quite proactively you you know liquidity to be prepared for,
uh,know any potential p p you know really worst case uh scenario further down the the road thank you and regarding,know any potential you know really worst so it s incoming quarters so that s your study there you know,
uh,the the road thank you and regarding the line of uh your balance sheet the line of bank and other loans,to the size of your loan book the size of your mpls and the size of the amount of loans,
uh,your balance sheet the line of bank and other loans uh which increased 81 in quarter one quarter do you do,as you can see on slide 17 net interest income decreased 4 year in year and 6 quarter on quarter,
uh,other debt issuances in coming quarters what your strategy there uh you know we we monitor constantly the different uh type,so it s incoming quarters so that s your study there you know we monitor constantly the different type of,
uh,there uh you know we we monitor constantly the different uh type of uh funding sources and depending on the the,s your study there you know we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the we,
uh,know we we monitor constantly the different uh type of uh funding sources and depending on the the specific uh uh,your study there you know we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the we you,
uh,of uh funding sources and depending on the the specific uh uh you know 10 year cost you know we end,know we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the we you know it s our,
uh,uh funding sources and depending on the the specific uh uh you know 10 year cost you know we end up,know we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the we you know it s our,
uh,end up you know we drawing or take advantage of uh the the different funding sources so you know i would,incoming quarters so that s your study there you know we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and,
uh,s our p obligation to look at better ways of uh uh you know not only funding the bank but you,know it s our obligation to look at better ways of you know not only funding the bank but you,
uh,our p obligation to look at better ways of uh uh you know not only funding the bank but you know,our obligation to look at better ways of you know not only funding the bank but you know keeping the,
uh,know not only funding the bank but you know keeping uh structures in place so that the bank you know can,know not only funding the bank but you know keeping the structures in place so that the bank you know,
uh,place so that the bank you know can continue supporting uh you know long growth so that s something that we,in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting you know long growth so that s something that,
uh,an opportunity to find you know a a more effective uh funding source inaudible thank you very much we ll take,opportunity to find you know a more effective funding source minister thank you very much we ll take the next,
uh,from yuri fernandes from j p morgan please go ahead uh thank you inaudible i have a question regarding the inaudible,from yuri fernandez from jp morgan please go ahead a little bit of difference but even on the players where,
uh,i have a question regarding the inaudible on npl ratio uh it was not inaudible quarter over quarter uh and i,how our clients are behaving okay now your second question regarding the exposure that we have to air mexico and,
uh,npl ratio uh it was not inaudible quarter over quarter uh and i understood that some peers they had higher tier,are not a big lender to the sector i mean i can tell you that if they re not in,
uh,jobs and that may explain a little bit of difference uh but given how the players uh where the inaudible was,jp morgan please go ahead a little bit of difference but even on the players where the charge was not,
uh,little bit of difference uh but given how the players uh where the inaudible was not as high uh we kind,a little bit of difference but even on the players where the charge was not as high we kind of,
uh,the players uh where the inaudible was not as high uh we kind of saw more flattish uh unk behavior uh,even on the players where the charge was not as high we kind of saw a more flat ish npl,
uh,not as high uh we kind of saw more flattish uh unk behavior uh because of the special accounting because of,as high we kind of saw a more flat ish npl behavior because of the special account and because of,
uh,uh we kind of saw more flattish uh unk behavior uh because of the special accounting because of the inaudible so,high we kind of saw a more flat ish npl behavior because of the special account and because of the,
uh,the iterations quarter for for you and my second qua uh question is regarding a special accounting criteria um when we,drove the iteration in this quarter for you and my second question is regarding the special accounting criteria when we,
uh,and i would like some kind of difference here like uh a very negative outlook would be to see you know,and i would like to understand the difference here like a very negative outlook would be to see you know,
uh,those numbers materializing as losses so if you can explain uh for me the differences on the special accounting versus the,like those numbers materializing as loss so if you can explain for me the differences on the special accounting versus,
uh,become losses i would appreciate thank you um hi yuri uh in terms of uh the npl ratio you know this,their need become losses i would appreciate it thank you hi yuri from 2 61 to 3 37 as we,
uh,appreciate thank you um hi yuri uh in terms of uh the npl ratio you know this this quarter what drove,it so thank you very much i think that you know the first of all you know the mpls that,
uh,2 61 to 3 37 um as as we discuss uh during the quarter during the call um uh you know,2 61 to 3 37 as we discussed during the call the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not,
uh,we discuss uh during the quarter during the call um uh you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did,we discussed during the call the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enroll in the support programs so,
uh,know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not uh enrolled in the in the support programs so but uh,we discussed during the call the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enroll in the support programs so,
uh,uh enrolled in the in the support programs so but uh we re seeing you know this slight deterioration has to,did not enroll in the support programs so what we re seeing you know this slide the tradition has to,
uh,you know a slight deterioration now on your second question uh could you elaborate on that you know i i don,you know a slight deterioration no on your second question could you elaborate on that and that you know i,
uh,the special accounting criteria to the other accounting criteria so uh the previous accounting um before inaudible the new regulation for,know the special account criteria to the other accounting criteria before the same regulation for covid you have like a,
uh,regulation for for covid um you have like a table uh on your release uh comparing uh the special accounting criteria,criteria before the same regulation for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria,
uh,um you have like a table uh on your release uh comparing uh the special accounting criteria versus the former i,regulation for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i,
uh,have like a table uh on your release uh comparing uh the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like,covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like,
uh,look to the old accounting criteria the the d6 accounting uh i think the balance of npls they are closer to,if you look to the old accounting criteria the b6 accounting i think the balance of npls they are closer,
uh,pesos so the npl ratio they would be much higher uh i understand that maybe a lot of loans that will,pesos so the npl ratio they would be much higher i understand that maybe a lot of loans that will,
uh,npl that they are there but my concern is that uh as soon as these accounting criteria go go goes back,not really become npls they are there but my concern is that as soon as these accounting criteria goes back,
uh,worsening um on that you know i think that that uh you know it it s thoroughly dependent on the level,sources and depending on the we you know it s our obligation to look at better ways of you know,
uh,the level of or or the type of assumptions that uh we make because uh the the system that accounting criteria,on that dependent on the level of or the type of assumptions that we make because the existing accounting criteria,
uh,or the type of assumptions that uh we make because uh the the system that accounting criteria is very stringent in,the level of or the type of assumptions that we make because the existing accounting criteria is very stringent in,
uh,a a let s say a inaudible and percentage of uh you know how much you you the client have paid,stringent in terms of let s say bad dues and percentage of you know how much the client has paid,
uh,s a in my opinion it s it s somehow uh extreme comparison okay so it it has to do with,that i think it s quite relevant those rates were coming up okay so that s one thing to have,
uh,has to do with you know um with the um uh special accounting criteria you basically uh allow clients not to,that and that you know i don t know exactly what you re comparing you know the special account criteria,
uh,um with the um uh special accounting criteria you basically uh allow clients not to pay uh uh you know or,know and under all the prevailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into you know you know how,
uh,accounting criteria you basically uh allow clients not to pay uh uh you know or every client that s not paying,of you know how much the client has paid back you know or every client that s not paying their,
uh,criteria you basically uh allow clients not to pay uh uh you know or every client that s not paying their,of you know how much the client has paid back you know or every client that s not paying their,
uh,paying their interest and capital stays current you know and uh under the old or the prevailing accounting criteria you know,not paying their interest in capital stays current you you know and under all the prevailing accounting criteria you know,

uh,on if you are you know let s say uh uh corporate client you know depending on how much you have,you know whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that,
uh,say that the presumptions are critical and i think that uh uh probably what it s what s important is to,said that there s still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the most severe numbers in,
uh,that the presumptions are critical and i think that uh uh probably what it s what s important is to understand,that the impact in nim that you see in this quarter i think is probably the most severe that we,
uh,the hard data you know we you know rather than uh you know comparing those numbers with big assumptions i think,the hard data you know just analyze you know if we you know on one hand the benefit of these,
uh,know comparing those numbers with big assumptions i think that uh uh as soon as clients start paying back or not,re going to see our numbers right as i mean we re going to take the provisions as soon as,
uh,comparing those numbers with big assumptions i think that uh uh as soon as clients start paying back or not we,going to see our numbers right as i mean we re going to take the provisions as soon as they,
uh,or not as mentioned during the call i think that uh we have make we have made a good assessment in,re not seeing that and i think that the bank has managed quite proactively you you know liquidity to be,
uh,account that s how we we come up with this uh provisions associated with expected losses that we assume so i,that s how we ve come up with these provisions associated with the spectacular losses that we assumed so i,
uh,hard data you know just analyze you know if we uh uh on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures,data you know just analyze you know if we you know on one hand the benefit of these temporary measures,

uh,one question i apologize if you already mentioned it um uh so you mentioned that 19 of the of the loan,to ask questions you have my question we wanted to make a quick follow up you mentioned that based on,
uh,you can tell us um what percentage of these clients uh that have resumed um payments already since it s been,in terms of what would be the percentage of these 19 of these clients under the release program that will,
uh,um end thank you you know first the payment holidays uh uh payment holiday period ends uh uh tomorrow so we,you back once the payment holiday ends thank you you know first the payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we,
uh,end thank you you know first the payment holidays uh uh payment holiday period ends uh uh tomorrow so we ll,back once the payment holiday ends thank you you know first the payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we ll,
uh,first the payment holidays uh uh payment holiday period ends uh uh tomorrow so we ll start the the you know,payment holiday ends thank you you know first the payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we ll start you know,
uh,the payment holidays uh uh payment holiday period ends uh uh tomorrow so we ll start the the you know seeing,holiday ends thank you you know first the payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we ll start you know they,
uh,tomorrow so we ll start the the you know seeing uh whether clients uh pay back or not uh starting next,tomorrow so we ll start you know they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that they,
uh,ll start the the you know seeing uh whether clients uh pay back or not uh starting next week so we,let s say bad dues and percentage of you know how much the client has paid back you know or,
uh,know seeing uh whether clients uh pay back or not uh starting next week so we don t have that information,number or low number of clients to pay back their loans that we feel relatively confident that with the information,
uh,information yet you know now regarding you know how we uh uh made provisions for uh for this quarter you know,and i somewhere around 10 to 12 percent then we have made with the provisions of this quarter you know,
uh,yet you know now regarding you know how we uh uh made provisions for uh for this quarter you know and,10 to 12 percent then we have made with the provisions of this quarter you know more than half of,
uh,regarding you know how we uh uh made provisions for uh for this quarter you know and as mentioned uh uh,around 10 to 12 percent then we have made with the provisions of this quarter you know more than half,
uh,for uh for this quarter you know and as mentioned uh uh throughout the call you know we classified um the,of this quarter you know more than half of what we require and that could be you know 60 to,
uh,uh for this quarter you know and as mentioned uh uh throughout the call you know we classified um the clients,of this quarter you know more than half of what we require and that could be you know 60 to,
uh,we classified um the clients depending on the risk that uh they have um the exposure that they have with us,payment holiday period ends tomorrow so we ll start you know they have the exposure that they have with us,
uh,inaudible in 11 clusters so depending on the level of uh uh of cluster that each uh client falls in you,difference and it makes sense to expect some worsening on that dependent on the level of or the type of,
uh,in 11 clusters so depending on the level of uh uh of cluster that each uh client falls in you know,sources and depending on the we you know it s our obligation to look at better ways of you know,
uh,on the level of uh uh of cluster that each uh client falls in you know there s either a high,there is a sector still of growth i mean as you know there is a lack of or a big,
uh,we came up with with the with the provisions that uh we we we made this quarter so yes there is,we can tell you that in the provisions that we made some of them are made for the alumexic exposure,
uh,of these analysis that we ve done that we feel uh relatively confident that with the information that we have what,of clients to pay back their loans that we feel relatively confident that with the information that we have what,

uh,uh that would be more interested in executing on those uh yeah i d say that um uh rather than pricing,that would get you more interested in executing on those and i think that s where these portfolios that are,
uh,executing on those uh yeah i d say that um uh rather than pricing just the markets and the systems that,you more interested in executing on those and i think that s where these portfolios that are out there they,
uh,pricing just the markets and the systems that they re uh associated with um the strength of those markets the opportunities,longer to close on but we have a good line of sight on those and are optimistic about the opportunities,
uh,the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth um uh is really a a key piece uh that we look,morning everyone congrats on the transaction that makes perfect sense to me now my focus is really on the outlook,
uh,for growth um uh is really a a key piece uh that we look at and i would also say that,down maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital thanks yeah i would say that,
uh,it look like sure um i would say that pricing uh for acquisitions has remained steady um the the cashflows and,what categories it looks like sure i would say that pricing for acquisitions has remained steady the cash flows in,
uh,the cashflows and and mobs has held up remarkably well uh during this period and i think that s a testament,the cash flows in mobs has held up remarkably well during this period and i think that s a testament,
uh,reliability of the asset class and so you re seeing uh again continued demand for the product um there ha ha,the security and reliability of the asset class and so you re seeing continued demand for the product there has,
uh,are that are temporarily on the sidelines but we see uh plenty of capital continuing to to participate in the space,a few buyers that are temporarily the sidelines but we see plenty of capital continuing to participate in the space,
uh,and so because of that we just haven t seen uh any any meaningful movement in cap rates the the other,continuing to participate in the space and we just haven t seen any meaningful movement in cap rates the other,
uh,seen cap rates sort of right in the mid fives uh for those portfolios so i think that sort of underscores,that you ve seen cap rates sort of right in the mid fives for those portfolios so i think that,
uh,come from vikram malhotra with morgan stanley please go ahead uh thanks for taking the question um this first one you,come from vikram mahaltra with morgan stanley please go ahead thanks for taking the question you know you had a,
uh,um this first one you know you had a nice uh improvement on the first day out um and you highlighted,ahead thanks for taking the question you know you had a nice improvement on the fad payout and you highlighted,
uh,maybe you jumped in but um remember we re all uh social distancing so we re we aren t as easily,maybe you jump in but remember we re to not talk over each other which i apologize chris but i,
uh,so we re we aren t as easily able to uh laugh not talk over each other which i apologize chris,on it maybe you jump in but remember we re to not talk over each other which i apologize chris,
uh,would say on the dividend you re exactly right vikram uh chris mentioned low 90s for this year and certainly we,would say on the dividend you re exactly right bicram chris mentioned low 90s for this year and certainly we,
uh,also talked about we ve got a lot of leasing uh strengthening as we go into the later part of this,also talked about we ve got a lot of leasing strengthening as we go into the later part of this,
uh,probably benefited us frankly in the second quarter and maybe uh even in the third would be a little less spending,probably benefited us frankly in the second quarter and maybe even in the third would be a little left spending,
uh,the third would be a little less spending on ti uh because of the slowdown in leasing we see that probably,the third would be a little left spending on ti because of the slowdown in leasing we see that probably,
uh,know it s it s a little early to tell uh exactly where we ll be for 21 but we like,next year so it s a little early to tell exactly where we ll be for 21 but we like,
uh,we like the direction generally where we re headed and uh we ll we ll certainly have a better sense of,but we like the direction generally where we re headed and we ll certainly have a better sense of that,
uh,the last several years it would be tied to that uh be tied to absorption and new leasing which is which,have been seeing the last several of years it would be tied to absorption and new leasing which is great,
uh,which is great um for longterm in terms of of uh earnings and such but uh but could you know slow,to absorption and new leasing which is great for long term in terms of earnings and such but could slow,
uh,longterm in terms of of uh earnings and such but uh but could you know slow the momentum um temporarily in,leasing which is great for long term in terms of earnings and such but could slow the momentum temporarily in,
uh,in the right direction okay great and then just um uh you know on the a bit more color on the,the in the right direction okay great and then just you know on a little bit more color on the,
uh,um when you look at the at the current pipeline uh the majority of it is is in on on an,you want to touch on maybe the current pipeline and what that might look like on versus off and then,4366302
uh,that that kind of fall into the on campus category uh by our definition and i think those are kind of,look like on versus off and then i can add to it definition and i think those are kind of,
uh,markets um that are markets where we already have investment uh and um you know i think that s where if,dick from about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment and that think that s where if,
uh,i would say we really like some of the tech uh you know job uh concentration that we see in a,so we really like the dynamic though of on an on an adjacent and and i could see you know,
uh,really like some of the tech uh you know job uh concentration that we see in a lot of the markets,really like the dynamic though of on an on an adjacent and and i could see you know the off,
uh,added you kind of asked that question about adding markets uh we just added san diego as rob pointed out in,and you know we have dialogue with the sellers or brokers in those markets that that we trust and and,
uh,raleigh the raleigh durham area which we liked as well uh but but merely 90 of what we ve been doing,the trends area which we like as well but really 90 of what we ve been doing 80 90 of,
uh,you um first i just wanna follow up on the uh the pipeline i m not sure if i m overly,from jordan sattler with key bank capital markets please go ahead great i m not sure if i m overly,
uh,sure if i m overly reading into your commentary but uh it sounded like you mentioned the large and growing pipeline,if i m overly reading into your commentary but it s standard like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline,
uh,s a challenging environment so it does make sense but uh i m guessing pro forma leverage with forward equity and,challenging environment so it doesn t make sense but i m guessing pro forma levered with the forward equity and,
uh,sellers or or or brokers in those markets that that uh we we trust and and you know are constantly trying,dialogue with the sellers or brokers in those markets that that we trust and and you know are constantly trying,
uh,that s where we see the growth in the pipeline uh coming and setting us up well for for 202 so,that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then moving,
uh,the confidence that we do because we see the dialogue uh that our team is having with these these sellers that,s there s more do because we see the dialogue that our team is having with these sellers that are,
uh,waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so uh we really liked the dynamic that of on an on,waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so we really like the dynamic though of on an on,
uh,the gap cap rate on that at disposition and then uh i m just curious what the escalators and gap cap,the gap cap rate on at this position and then i m just serious with the escalators and gap gap,
uh,to two nine range um in terms of escalators and uh you know it it varies on the impact of the,the 2 8 to 2 9 range in in terms of escalators and it varies on the impact of to,
uh,know it it varies on the impact of the gap uh based off of the term that is inside of our,and it varies on the impact of to gap based off of the term that s acquisitions but in general,
uh,the gap adds about 25 to 50 basis points um uh to the to the cap rate on a gap basis,we typically say the gap adds about 25 to 50 basis points to to cap rate on a gap basis,
uh,to the to the cap rate on a gap basis uh in our acquisitions okay thanks for clarifying our next question,cap rate on a gap basis in our acquisitions which we clarify our next question will come from lucas hartrich,
uh,please go ahead thanks everyone for your time this morning uh this is john on for lucas uh just a quick,please go ahead i thank everyone for your time this morning this is john i m for lucas just a,
uh,time this morning uh this is john on for lucas uh just a quick one from me uh just looking at,this morning this is john i m for lucas just a quick one for me just looking at the improvements,
uh,on for lucas uh just a quick one from me uh just looking at the improvements in your expectations for the,m for lucas just a quick one for me just looking at the improvements your expectations for the cash releasing,
uh,for the cash releasing spreads on the multi tenant side uh you know what s behind that optimism uh i ll,for the cash releasing spreads on the multi tenant side you know what s behind that optimism obviously the year,
uh,tenant side uh you know what s behind that optimism uh i ll say the usa trends are pretty favorable and,multi tenant side you know what s behind that optimism obviously the year to day trends are pretty favorable and,
uh,s actually some opportunity for some outside there as well uh thank you very much yeah if you really look at,if there s actually some opportunity for some outside there as well thank you very much on the cash leasing,
uh,t wanna be overly aggressive um you know not having uh a lot of of leasing data uh in the midst,taking we didn t want to be overly aggressive and not having a lot of leasing data in the midst,
uh,know not having uh a lot of of leasing data uh in the midst of of what was going on and,and not having a lot of leasing data in the midst of what was going on releases during the quarter,
uh,had taken um had taken down our expectations but as uh as we uh worked releases during the quarter and continued,a lot of leasing data in the midst of what was going on releases during the quarter and continued our,
uh,had taken down our expectations but as uh as we uh worked releases during the quarter and continued our discussions um,of leasing data in the midst of what was going on releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you,
uh,our discussions um you know things have have really shown uh um great um you know resilience and so uh our,on releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you know things have really shown great resilience and so our,
uh,shown uh um great um you know resilience and so uh our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads we ll,discussions you know things have really shown great resilience and so our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads will,
uh,seeing previously um which longterm we say we we expect uh three to four uh and and so we re we,seeing previously which long term we we say we expect three to four and so far we re seeing that,
uh,longterm we say we we expect uh three to four uh and and so we re we re uh so far,long term we we say we expect three to four and so far we re seeing that those types of,
uh,to four uh and and so we re we re uh so far we re seeing that uh those types of,long term we we say we expect three to four and so far we re seeing that those types of,
uh,re we re uh so far we re seeing that uh those types of metrics are are holding up well and,say we expect three to four and so far we re seeing that those types of metrics are holding and,
uh,sort of a a reversal of you know elective surgery uh shutdowns and whatnot um can you can you discuss that,was a bit of a carve out for a fc s you know in some of the outpatient surgeries it,
uh,even though the availability or or states are allowing for uh elective surgeries are people really jumping in and and doing,re encouraged i mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible so i don t,
uh,that will be the case okay um my second question uh and last question is what what is your perspective of,will be the case okay my second question and last question is what is your perspective of how the hospital,
uh,that you know we kind of went in over hospitals uh to begin with and and and maybe this fast tracks,that you know we kind of went in over hospital to begin with and maybe this fast traction or closings,
uh,closings that probably or maybe would ve just happened eventually uh i m just wondering if if you think sort of,closings that probably or maybe would have not happened eventually i m just wondering if you think sort of picking,
uh,versus small independent system obviously you know more more urban uh versus in suburban versus rural is gonna be a huge,the you know low to mid fives is where on average those are going to be are you i guess,
uh,demand need based business you know this isn t just uh you know selling uh luxury items it s it s,demand need based business this isn t just selling luxury items it s very much need based and so there,
uh,you know this isn t just uh you know selling uh luxury items it s it s very much need based,this is a demand need based business this isn t just selling luxury items it s very much need based,
uh,think um you know all those innovations will continue and uh it will be more a little bit more of a,think all those innovations will continue and it will be a little bit more of a winner versus loser at,
uh,propensity you know to to want to own their assets uh so a little different but we ve heard of a,propensity to want to own their assets so a little different well we ve heard of a few other anecdotes,
uh,just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so uh you know hospital systems think strategically very differently they don,just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so you know hospital systems think strategically very differently they don,
uh,that will help also but even without a lot of uh of increased absorption you can see same store uh noi,that will help also but even without a lot of increased absorption you can see same store igros running around,
uh,of uh of increased absorption you can see same store uh noi growth running you know around three and how does,but even without a lot of increased absorption you can see same store igros running around three and how does,
uh,running you know around three and how does free rent uh impact this number cause i imagine you re offering more,store igros running around three and how does free rent impact this number because i imagine you re offering more,
uh,of new leasing um and so when you have that uh with the new leasing it just kind of creates a,inside of new leasing and so when you have that with the new leasing it just kind of creates a,
uh,the the the revenue impact from that absorption um but uh but overall no we ve we ve not seen um,of a delay before you see the revenue impact from that absorption but overall no we ve not seen a,
uh,a marked expansion of of free rent okay and then uh maybe i ll ask nick joseph s question a little,marked expansion of free rent okay and then maybe i ll ask nick joseph s question a little bit differently,
uh,or so or have any of those deals fallen apart uh yes we re still on track to to close those,million or so or have any of those deals fallen apart yes we re still on track to close those,
uh,proceeds reinvested by year end right and the four adjacent uh acquisitions uh you you mentioned are just a rated health,proceeds reinvested by year end hospital next door i think there s one where the hospital is not a tenant,
uh,by year end right and the four adjacent uh acquisitions uh you you mentioned are just a rated health systems are,about at they re kind of right on top of each other in terms of the new acquisitions that we,
uh,from todd stender with wells fargo please go ahead thanks uh probably in order just to stick with that last theme,from todd stinder with wells fargo please go ahead probably in order just to stick with that last theme about,
uh,create absorption which is where you have higher ti spend uh in in the second quarter you know especially april and,new tenants that create absorption which is where you have higher ti spend in the second quarter especially april and,
uh,a little below the low end of our guidance range uh as it relates to second gen ti um and so,frankly a little below the low end as it relates to second gen ti and so there s just timing,
uh,there s just timing that is always related to that uh so that may you know pick up certainly we think,so there s just timing that is always related to that so that may pick up certainly we think will,
uh,is playing into the guidance as as it relates to uh defad in my prepared remarks i ve talked about you,playing into the guidance as it relates to fad and my i prepared remarks i talked about you know right,
uh,the year and and what drives our our view that uh our fad payout ratio will will probably end up the,later half of the year and what drives our view that our fad payout ratio will probably end up the,
uh,the year down in the in the low 90 s uh not in the low 80 s that you saw this,will probably end up the year down in the low 90s not in the low 80s that you saw this,
uh,with mizuho please go ahead oh yes good morning everyone uh congrats on the transaction it makes perfect sense to me,okuseya with mizuho please go ahead yes good morning everyone congrats on the transaction that makes perfect sense to me,
uh,congrats on the transaction it makes perfect sense to me uh my focus is really on the outlook for the mobs,congrats on the transaction that makes perfect sense to me now my focus is really on the outlook for the,
uh,i think you mentioned in your comments earlier on that uh you know hospitals in general and associate level they seem,mobs i think you mentioned in your comments earlier on that hospitals in general and associated will seem to be,
uh,they ve kind of received over this period as well uh could you just kind of talk about how you re,grants they ve kind of received over this period as well i m gonna talk about how you re thinking,
uh,is decreased maybe in the next you know act that uh that congress enacts you know what do you kind of,you know it s kind of it s the hot spot it s these you know fires that kind of,
uh,the most extreme thing hopefully that we ll ever see uh in our lifetimes right but maybe not uh amen to,are no grants or in a world where uh in our lifetimes right but maybe not uh a month about,
uh,ever see uh in our lifetimes right but maybe not uh amen to that right right so you know april was,where uh in our lifetimes right but maybe not uh a month about right right so you know april was,
uh,learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals uh you know good or bad you know hospitals and physicians,ve learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals uh you know good or bad you know hospital,
uh,they really make a lot of money on the elective uh procedure side in surgeries and when that was shut down,they really make a lot of money on the elective uh procedure side and surgery than when that was shut,
uh,so when you cut off that lifeblood if you will uh it really hurts the system so i think now if,our view that our fad payout ratio will probably end up the year down in the low 90s not in,
uh,to curtailing expenses and reducing working capital without sacrificing key uh strategic investments working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity,versus 17 2 percent in without sacrificing key strategic investments working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity in the,
uh,we got you jeff yeah yeah great good morning so uh don uh i i think i just wanna start with,we got you jeff great i just want to start with the july comments i really want to understand maybe,
uh,you jeff yeah yeah great good morning so uh don uh i i think i just wanna start with the july,you jeff great i just want to start with the july comments i really want to understand maybe the message,
uh,maybe the message that you want to have out there uh it sounds like you make the argument that july was,maybe the message that you want to have out there it sounds like you could make the argument that july,
uh,was getting back towards flat ish year over year levels uh according to what jorge said but how much of that,argument that july was getting back towards year over year levels according to what jorge said but how much of,
uh,of that might be sell in that was recovering off uh some sell in issues earlier in the quarter or earlier,of that might be sell in that was recovering off some sell in issues earlier in the quarter or earlier,

uh,number thanks yeah thanks jeff um you you know look uh i think jorge said it clearly in the uh prepared,in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff you know look i think jorge said it clearly in the prepared,
uh,look uh i think jorge said it clearly in the uh prepared remarks as we were as as we were looking,yeah thanks jeff you know look i think jorge said it clearly in the prepared remarks as we re looking,
uh,we were looking at july there s places that have uh you know we re seeing good progress in in some,as we re looking at july there s places that have you know we re seeing good progress in some,
uh,couple things we re looking at and um you know uh that s that s one of the reasons we re,see exactly there s a couple of things where looking at and that s one of the reasons we re,
uh,that s one of the reasons we re not being uh okay let s just go project july into august september,that s one of the reasons we re not being okay let s just go project july into august september,
uh,volume and we ve seen that as good office capacity uh we see office capacity kind of improving our our patient,patient volume and we ve seen that as good office capacity we see office capacity kind of improving our patient,
uh,of improving our our patient tracking is telling us that uh you know confidence in the dentist office continues to go,capacity kind of improving our patient tracking is telling us that confidence in the dentist s office continues to go,
uh,and what that in in our mind means that okay uh look if if we re getting capacity in the in,and what that in our mind means that okay look if we re getting capacity in the dentist office back,
uh,think we re working to inaudible of patients right now uh and then i i think y you know from an,think we re working through a bolus of patients right now and then i think from an inventory perspective our,
uh,the dentist office ultimately are working through the fact that uh y you know when when the pandemic started i think,the dentist office so ultimately if things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back,
uh,consumable and technol you know the the t e side uh a and we believe that is a lot to do,jeff the difference between our consumable and the t e side and we believe that is a lot to do,
uh,we believe that is a lot to do with okay uh we don t know how long the office is gonna,we believe that is a lot to do with okay we don t know how long the office is going,

uh,of the margin recovery relative to how we think about uh revenues next year thanks yeah jeff it s it s,the margin recovery relative to how we think about revenues next year jeff it s early for us to really,
uh,it s early for us to to really forecast 202 uh i i would tell you the steps we took around,year jeff it s early for us to really forecast 2021 i would tell you the steps we took around,
uh,reflect our interest in sitting there saying hey look d uh we we need to get back on the margin progression,reflect our interest in sitting there saying hey look we need steps to do it i think the results here,
uh,i think w i think we have to take s uh organizational steps to do it i think the results uh,in sitting there saying hey look we need steps to do it i think the results here show you that,

uh,margin basis and uh you know what we ve seen uh obviously our margin is revenue dependent and uh you you,margin basis and what we ve seen obviously our margin is revenue dependent and hey look don t think that,

uh,drive margin and you know we we were very clear uh uh you know i i joke with john sweeney occasionally,really going to be able to drive margin we were very clear you know i joke with john sweeney occasionally,
uh,margin and you know we we were very clear uh uh you know i i joke with john sweeney occasionally that,going to be able to drive margin we were very clear you know i joke with john sweeney occasionally that,

uh,how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors uh around potential additional destocking uh good morning tycho uh this,and how much incremental risk is there going forward with distributors around potential additional de stocking it s hard to,
uh,there going forward with distributors uh around potential additional destocking uh good morning tycho uh this is jorge it is uh,is there going forward with distributors around potential additional de stocking it s hard to give any precise number but,
uh,distributors uh around potential additional destocking uh good morning tycho uh this is jorge it is uh you know it it,distributors around potential additional de stocking it s hard to give any precise number but as don just indicated in,
uh,uh good morning tycho uh this is jorge it is uh you know it it s hard to um give a,hi good morning guys this was wondering if you could help us put some numbers around the new ortho strategy,
uh,a any precise number but as as don just indicated uh in the case of consumables uh there is a uh,hard to give any precise number but as don just indicated in the case of consumables there is a the,
uh,as don just indicated uh in the case of consumables uh there is a uh the the order lead time is,precise number but as don just indicated in the case of consumables there is a the order lead time is,
uh,uh in the case of consumables uh there is a uh the the order lead time is very short and so,in the case of consumables there is a the order lead time is very short meaningful from a long term,
uh,the the order lead time is very short and so uh when the pandemic hit uh customers and and dealers and,there is a the order lead time is very short meaningful from a long term perspective listen at the end,
uh,is very short and so uh when the pandemic hit uh customers and and dealers and in general in the in,as we recover from the pandemic it could but we ve seen demand remain pretty solid on there and in,
uh,in the market place there was a a reaction to uh to manage inventories very very closely and uh when we,5 5 in the quarter up from 25 3 in the prior year a function of the change in the,
uh,reaction to uh to manage inventories very very closely and uh when we look at the data of uh retail sales,listen at the end of the day we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales is,
uh,closely and uh when we look at the data of uh retail sales and our sales uh there there are a,listen at the end of the day we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales is,
uh,at the data of uh retail sales and our sales uh there there are a lot of indications that show that,at the end of the day we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales is that,
uh,there there are a lot of indications that show that uh there was a a reduction in the inventory levels that,objective that s how we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i think in,
uh,there was a a reduction in the inventory levels that uh we historically or typically uh uh carry in in the,if there s any detail you can give there on just like how that s shaken out geographically and if,
uh,in the inventory levels that uh we historically or typically uh uh carry in in the network so uh there was,objective that s how we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i think in,
uh,the inventory levels that uh we historically or typically uh uh carry in in the network so uh there was an,objective that s how we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i think in,
uh,or typically uh uh carry in in the network so uh there was an element of that and um when that,the dentist in the next six months so you know there s a little bit of a lag there that,
uh,element of that and um when that comes back to uh to typical levels is is hard to uh to project,like you could make the argument that july was getting back towards year over year levels according to what jorge,
uh,back to uh to typical levels is is hard to uh to project uh some of that may be happening as,back towards year over year levels according to what jorge said but how much of that might be sell in,
uh,to typical levels is is hard to uh to project uh some of that may be happening as uh as as,year over year levels according to what jorge said but how much of that might be sell in that was,
uh,to project uh some of that may be happening as uh as as don indicated uh but i don t think,the first is that you know i think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think,
uh,that may be happening as uh as as don indicated uh but i don t think that is uh something that,i think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think it s going to happen in,
uh,don indicated uh but i don t think that is uh something that uh for us um is going to be,better endo it lets you do better orthodontist so we think that demand you know is it going to gyrate,
uh,but i don t think that is uh something that uh for us um is going to be uh meaningful from,you know i don t think it s going to happen in the immediate short term but i think if,
uh,something that uh for us um is going to be uh meaningful from a long term perspective listen at the end,is a the order lead time is very short meaningful from a long term perspective listen at the end of,
uh,at the end of the day we always want to uh make sure that our sales match retail sales that that,at the end of the day we always want to make sure that our sales match retail sales is that,
uh,our key objective that s how we we make money uh there will be always uh small fluctuations in in the,our key objective that s how we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i,
uh,how we we make money uh there will be always uh small fluctuations in in the network uh so i i,how we make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i think in given the magnitude,
uh,will be always uh small fluctuations in in the network uh so i i think in given the magnitude of the,make money there will be always small fluctuations in the network so i think in given the magnitude of the,
uh,have in in many places i i think that is uh it that that noise is not actually meaningful in terms,have in many places i think that noise is not actually meaningful explaining our performance and our trajectory over the,
uh,not actually meaningful in terms of explaining our performance and uh our you know trajectory over the next several months okay,think that noise is not actually meaningful explaining our performance and our trajectory over the next several months okay and,
uh,re we re actually there s a component of the uh you know the wire bending aspect of of suresmile that,remarks as we re looking at july there s places that have you know we re seeing good progress in,
uh,aspect of of suresmile that we re keeping um what uh when we say uh how we kinda delineate traditional orthopaedic,smile that we re keeping when we say how we kind of delineate traditional ortho it s kind of the,
uh,that we re keeping um what uh when we say uh how we kinda delineate traditional orthopaedic which is kind of,smile that we re keeping when we say how we kind of delineate traditional ortho it s kind of the,
uh,straight up on a orthodon t an orthodontist using orthodontia uh the the we believe hybrid is meaningful we believe that,brackets bands that would go straight up on an orthodontist using orthodontia we believe hybrid is meaningful we believe that,
uh,we re getting real traction on suresmile tends to be uh s you know right now focused around our cerec base,as if we re going to get the restructuring done and then that s it you know we re not,
uh,base um y you know we kinda made that shift uh at y basically in october of last year and that,in the steep year over year decline one area in sg a that actually increased over last year was bad,
uh,were gonna be dissynergies associated with getting out of traditional uh y you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist uh group,feel that there were going to be disenergies associated with getting out of traditional orthodontist treatment among the orthodontist group,
uh,traditional uh y you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist uh group so uh you know as we focus on growing,be disenergies associated with getting out of traditional orthodontist treatment among the orthodontist group so as we focus on growing,
uh,you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist uh group so uh you know as we focus on growing in the future,with getting out of traditional orthodontist treatment among the orthodontist group so as we focus on growing in the future,
uh,to think all right how do we take care of uh how do we take advantage of our digital assets and,to think all right how do we take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and,
uh,be a little bit more flexible in terms of financing uh or pricing potentially um you know it it s been,back half of the year and then think about you know primescan and primemill potentially you know it s been,
uh,it it s been interesting tycho w j even before uh the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to,potentially you know it s been interesting tycho even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to,
uh,pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to one uh you know our theory of one visit dentistry and with,tycho even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to our theory of one visit dentistry with,
uh,made that a reality i mean you you can get uh patients in and out with a single unit crown in,primel it really made that a reality i mean you can get patients time you re also seeing a lot,
uh,went down we really shifted to a bunch of digital uh d whether it was dem product demonstrations or you know,had really positive experiences around how people you know whether it s you know adjusting waiting room or you know,
uh,got a pretty good reception so what we ve seen uh to date and and you ve actually seen the results,to happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we re seeing with covid you know it s covid and,
uh,seen the results that there s a pretty good appetite uh in our mind for technology and equipment now whether it,through that so we re we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment space in the,
uh,the patient population that may be a little bit hey uh do i wanna go to the dentist three times in,go back in the next month versus do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six,
uh,i wanna go to the dentist three times in in uh you know during the pandemic to get a crown fixed,do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months so you know there s a,
uh,during the pandemic to think through that so we re uh w we feel good about where we are from the,downtime during the pandemic to think through that so we re we feel good about where we are from the,
uh,good about where we are from the technology and equipment uh space in the back half and uh and a large,we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment space in the back half and in a,
uh,technology and equipment uh space in the back half and uh and a large part is due to the first the,technology and equipment space in the back half and in a large part it s due to first the new,
uh,make sure that we re helping dentists access this material uh you know but we re do i s do i,make sure that we re helping dennis access this material a bunch of pricing pressure and you know crazy financing,
uh,from steven valiquette with barclays please go ahead hey thanks uh good morning everybody um a couple of quick questions for,with beard please go ahead thank you good morning guys can you hear me okay i think it was on,
uh,for you you know first your comment around july being uh fairly flat year over year on a global basis is,out there it sounds like you could make the argument that july was getting back towards year over year levels,
uh,obviously pretty positive and i don t wanna give any uh specific guidance but just kind of eyeballing the three consensus,i want to ask one very specific question and then one kind of big picture question the specific one is,
uh,of eyeballing the three consensus estimates for the third quarter uh they call for revenues to be down some 20 to,in given the magnitude of the changes that we experienced in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues,
uh,july and you know barring any other major changes in uh the landscape does that you know is that a number,obviously you start with the works council and you go through a lot of different things you know the numbers,
uh,listen i it is it is early for us to uh be able to extrapolate um from the july numbers uh,think about revenues next year jeff it s early for us to really forecast 2021 i would tell you the,
uh,uh be able to extrapolate um from the july numbers uh and as uh as you can appreciate uh there is,on implants being able to integrate that and expand that on the base of what they used to operate in,
uh,to extrapolate um from the july numbers uh and as uh as you can appreciate uh there is a lot of,it really made that a reality i mean you can get patients time you re also seeing a lot of,
uh,july numbers uh and as uh as you can appreciate uh there is a lot of uh different data points coming,in multiple locations obviously you start with the works council and you go through a lot of different things you,
uh,as you can appreciate uh there is a lot of uh different data points coming from uh different regions and uh,list some of those most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions and with,
uh,is a lot of uh different data points coming from uh different regions and uh there are some markets that are,on the products at this point i can t give you a breakdown because there are some analytics that we,
uh,uh different data points coming from uh different regions and uh there are some markets that are doing much better uh,at this point i can t give you a breakdown because there are some analytics that we still need to,
uh,uh there are some markets that are doing much better uh in terms of the number of offices that are open,because there are some analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in some,
uh,still have lingering concerns in places like australia parts of uh latin america and there are some spots in in europe,so patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and again we re seeing some good positive things there,
uh,there are some spots in in europe that are also uh still challenging so and it is it is very hard,there are some analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in some instances,
uh,very hard to um make a judgment with respect to uh those numbers i think uh what we are what we,they to use the kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that so we re we feel,
uh,a judgment with respect to uh those numbers i think uh what we are what we re really encouraged by the,we think we can take steps at a certain revenue base that we re really going to be able to,
uh,re really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last uh three months have been you know moving in the right,i really want to understand maybe the message that you want to have out there it sounds like you could,
uh,moving in the right direction but from a planning perspective uh internally we we are we re trying to we continue,details from a geographical perspective in the u s virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to,
uh,we continue to work with scenario planning we we are uh preparing the company for for a multiple uh set of,balicat with bartiz please go ahead great thanks tycho planning we are preparing the company for a multiple set of,
uh,we are uh preparing the company for for a multiple uh set of uh of outcomes in the next uh in,we are preparing the company for a multiple set of outcomes in the next few i think is the prudent,
uh,preparing the company for for a multiple uh set of uh of outcomes in the next uh in the next few,preparing the company for a multiple set of outcomes in the next few i think is the prudent thing to,
uh,multiple uh set of uh of outcomes in the next uh in the next few uh months and quarters i think,thanks tycho planning we are preparing the company for a multiple set of outcomes in the next few i think,
uh,of outcomes in the next uh in the next few uh months and quarters i think it s important thing to,preparing the company for a multiple set of outcomes in the next few i think is the prudent thing to,
uh,i think it s important thing to do so um uh har hard to tell you uh if if that number,in the next few i think is the prudent thing to do so hard to tell you if that number,
uh,to do so um uh har hard to tell you uh if if that number is right or not okay that,is the prudent thing to do so hard to tell you if that number is right or not okay that,
uh,right or not okay that s helpful one other quick uh clarification question on the exiting of the traditional orthodontics and,or not okay that s helpful one other quick clarification question question on the exiting of the traditional orthodontics in,
uh,it right now we re we re making the announcement uh to get it done obviously we ll look to dispose,sitting there saying hey we re we re going to go sell you an omni we re going to go,
uh,way that it s most beneficial to the company if uh you know there s some asset sales we ll certainly,as part of that one company approach stuff like ds1 you know one ds excuse me we really are going,
uh,look at it if if it s a full shutdown uh you know we we gave you guys the the numbers,we need steps to do it i think the results here show you that you know we think we ve,
uh,we we gave you guys the the numbers based on uh you know the worst case scenario and obviously we re,of different things you know the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and we re going,
uh,re gonna work to improve that um but but again uh the the process because uh you know we mentioned in,exiting of the traditional orthodontics in parts of the analog lab business but again the process because we mentioned in,
uh,that um but but again uh the the process because uh you know we mentioned in the prepared remarks it s,in parts of the analog lab business but again the process because we mentioned in the prepared remarks it s,
uh,but you know the the numbers we gave you represent uh you know the base case and and we re gonna,of different things you know the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and we re going,
uh,from michael cherny with bank of america please go ahead uh good morning and and thanks for the questions i i,from michael charney with bank of america i apologize to keep harvey on this but i just want to make,
uh,just wanna make sure this is clear as possible y uh jorge are you saying that what you s have seen,just want to make sure this is clear as possible jorge are you saying that what you have seen so,
uh,seen so far in july on a total dollar basis uh across the book is similar to 2019 is there any,so far in july on a total dollar basis across book is similar to 2019 is there any way specifically,
uh,that could be growing clearly at a faster inaudible yeah uh michael thanks for the question we we are still trying,that could be growing clearly a faster clip yeah michael thanks for the question indicated before july definitely trended better,
uh,we are still trying to digest all the july numbers uh there is a lot of uh a lot of data,we were trying to watch as they were kind of the flare ups in the u s a drop off,
uh,all the july numbers uh there is a lot of uh a lot of data to look at from a product,a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so when,
uh,look at from a product perspective from a geography perspective uh a as i as i indicated before um july definitely,covid spikes that could be growing clearly a faster clip yeah michael thanks for the question indicated before july definitely,
uh,before um july definitely trended better than june um so uh that that that is very good uh but it is,before july definitely trended better than june so that is very good but it depends on the region it depends,
uh,june um so uh that that that is very good uh but it is uh it it depends on the region,question indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that is very good but it depends on the region,
uh,that that that is very good uh but it is uh it it depends on the region it depends on the,definitely trended better than june so that is very good but it depends on the region it depends on the,
uh,point i can t give you a breakdown um because uh there is some some analytics that we need we still,the products at this point i can t give you a breakdown because there are some analytics that we still,
uh,to do overall um the um the the total portfolio uh is is getting closer to uh 19 numbers and in,breakdown because there are some analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in,
uh,the the total portfolio uh is is getting closer to uh 19 numbers and in some instances uh i it did,some analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in some instances it did,
uh,getting closer to uh 19 numbers and in some instances uh i it did better than uh than 201 and uh,getting closer to 19 numbers and in some instances it did better than 2019 and that is definitely a substantial,
uh,and in some instances uh i it did better than uh than 201 and uh and and that is uh definitely,do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in some instances it did better than 2019 and that is definitely,

uh,than uh than 201 and uh and and that is uh definitely a substantial improvement uh versus versus june yeah and,in some instances it did better than 2019 and that is definitely a substantial improvement and then just one more,
uh,uh and and that is uh definitely a substantial improvement uh versus versus june yeah and then just one more question,some instances it did better than 2019 and that is definitely a substantial improvement and then just one more question,
uh,it s our system um look between omni and primescan uh you know we think we ve got a pretty installed,think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think it s going to happen in the,
uh,know we think we ve got a pretty installed base uh we we have a very loyal user group there that,that it s our system a pretty good installed base we have a very loyal user group there that is,
uh,package and particularly you know when we came out with uh suresmile 7 6 uh it and it it s really,package and particularly when we came out with sure and you know we re very comfortable with the clinical results,
uh,know when we came out with uh suresmile 7 6 uh it and it it s really seamlessly integrated uh into,smile into the package and particularly when we came out with sure and you know we re very comfortable with,
uh,6 uh it and it it s really seamlessly integrated uh into y you know our base uh digital assets it,with the clinical results we re seeing and as we go into you know kind of our installed base we,
uh,really seamlessly integrated uh into y you know our base uh digital assets it it becomes really easy to use and,take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and how do we really look at expanding,
uh,broad broad portfolio into class one class two class three uh we we think that our treatment planning uh software is,about our portfolio we think we ve started to actually get our obviously we ve talked about our immediate load,
uh,class three uh we we think that our treatment planning uh software is second to none i mean we we feel,where we re sitting there saying hey we re we re going to go sell you an omni we re,
uh,second to none i mean we we feel it s uh uh really really competitive and um you know we re,sl on our l line and now wide field of view we feel that we re very competitive in the,
uh,to none i mean we we feel it s uh uh really really competitive and um you know we re very,like sure smile into the package and particularly when we came out with sure and you know we re very,
uh,clinical results we re seeing and as we go into uh y you know kind of our installed base we feel,clinical results we re seeing and as we go into you know kind of our installed base we feel very,
uh,that right now um a and look every single day uh we get better and better at beginning to think about,potentially you know it s been interesting tycho even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to,
uh,ve begun to focus much more on how do we uh focus on the customer as as one company and and,really we ve begun to focus much more on how do we focus on the customer as one company and,
uh,and as part of that one company approach stuff like uh ds1 uh you know 1ds excuse me uh we really,company and as part of that one company approach stuff like ds1 you know one ds excuse me we really,
uh,part of that one company approach stuff like uh ds1 uh you know 1ds excuse me uh we really are going,as part of that one company approach stuff like ds1 you know one ds excuse me we really are going,
uh,stuff like uh ds1 uh you know 1ds excuse me uh we really are going in and saying hey look how,approach stuff like ds1 you know one ds excuse me we really are going in and saying hey look how,
uh,um bednar with piper sandler please go ahead good morning uh thanks for taking the questions here uh don and jorge,with stiefel please go ahead hi this is trevor rohn for john thanks for taking my questions i m wondering,
uh,ahead good morning uh thanks for taking the questions here uh don and jorge uh thanks for all the restructuring plan,ahead hi this is trevor rohn for john thanks for taking my questions i m wondering if there s any,
uh,thanks for taking the questions here uh don and jorge uh thanks for all the restructuring plan cover uh wondering in,john thanks for taking my questions i m wondering if there s any detail you can give there on just,
uh,and jorge uh thanks for all the restructuring plan cover uh wondering in the orthodontic business i mean you you ve,now some of the tailwinds from the restructuring that we re probably still continuing from the past plan how do,
uh,few times leveraging the cerec installed base with clear aligners uh i think it makes a ton of sense but i,to be and whether it gets there in two years three years five years i think it s going to,
uh,large installed base and when we do programs like 1ds uh we re you know we re we re obviously trying,like sure smile into the package and particularly when we came out with sure and you know we re very,
uh,you know we re we re obviously trying to package uh you know workflows together in such a way that we,you know i think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think it s going to,
uh,more success there so look we will continue to pitch uh suresmile across both the orthodontics orthodontic as well as the,of success with saying hey look i got to change how i practice and they to use the kind of,
uh,channel right now that s helpful okay and then i uh wanted to ask actually a new product question here actually,have a large that s helpful okay and then i wanted to ask actually a new product question here actually,
uh,the recently approved large field of view imaging system or uh maybe any 3d printing plans you might have with primeprint,recently approved large field of view imaging system or maybe any 3d printing plans you might have with prime print,
uh,maybe any 3d printing plans you might have with primeprint uh maybe you could talk to what you see in the,maybe any 3d printing plans you might have with prime print maybe you could talk to what you see in,
uh,field of view and also in office 3d printing thanks uh on you know wide field of view i i we,of large field of view and also in office 3d printing thanks on you know wide field of view we,
uh,done with you know our orthophos sl and our unk uh and now wide field of view we we feel that,we ve done with our orthophose sl on our l line and now wide field of view we feel that,
uh,that we re very competitive in the imaging space and uh you know uh now in terms of where do we,that we re very competitive in the imaging space and now in terms of what do we think about the,
uh,very competitive in the imaging space and uh you know uh now in terms of where do we think about the,very competitive in the imaging space and now in terms of what do we think about the macro demand for,
uh,terms of where do we think about the macro demand uh for imaging equipment again uh s you know if you,terms of what do we think about the macro demand for imaging equipment again if you look over the last,
uh,think about the macro demand uh for imaging equipment again uh s you know if you look over the last six,think about the macro demand for imaging equipment again if you look over the last six months and again the,
uh,the pandemic really started you know at the end of uh the first quarter and we ve seen regions begin to,the pandemic really started at the end of the first quarter and we ve seen regions begin to recover seem,
uh,first quarter and we ve seen regions begin to recover uh you know we ve seen good solid demand a across,first quarter and we ve seen regions begin to recover seem good solid demand across the board in technology and,
uh,demand a across the board in technology and equipment and uh you know it s when you start looking at things,solid demand across the board in technology and equipment and you know it s when you start looking at things,
uh,and particularly when you start looking at 2d and 3d uh kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures,and particularly when you start looking at 2d and 3d kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures,
uh,we recover from the pi pandemic it it could but uh you know we ve seen demand remain pretty solid on,we recover from the pandemic it could but we ve seen demand remain pretty solid on there and in terms,
uh,one of the challenges in in um in this space uh you know versus other med device spaces where you can,really discussed that and look one of the challenges in this space versus other med device spaces where you can,
uh,device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out uh you know we we tend to play things pretty close,this space versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out we tend to play things,
uh,we tend to play things pretty close to the vest uh what what i would tell you is that our new,things that we need to get after even faster so that s kind of what i would tell you is,
uh,strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and uh you know th what we ve been working on internally,on our key strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and what we ve been working on internally,
uh,we if you could help us put some numbers around uh the new ortho strategy um can you talk about um,good morning guys this was wondering if you could help us put some numbers around the new ortho strategy maybe,
uh,it s funny we we we haven t broken out uh you know the total orthodontia business and we don t,the steps we re taking around getting out of the traditional ortho business and really focusing on clear liners helps,
uh,know the total orthodontia business and we don t give uh the clear aligner numbers specifically what i would tell you,things that we need to get after even faster so that s kind of what i would tell you is,
uh,aligner numbers specifically what i would tell you is that uh what we ve seen uh over the last year is,that right now and if you look at what we ve done with our orthophose sl on our l line,
uh,would tell you is that uh what we ve seen uh over the last year is accelerating growth behind suresmile uh,now and if you look at what we ve done with our orthophose sl on our l line and now,
uh,uh over the last year is accelerating growth behind suresmile uh and and we ve seen actually very positive trends even,a couple things i mean first we re doing patient tracking across the entire globe and again we ve seen,
uh,the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision um uh look we we feel that uh dentsply sirona has an,there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we ve done with,
uh,about that decision um uh look we we feel that uh dentsply sirona has an opportunity to become a solid number,about that right now and if you look at what we ve done with our orthophose sl on our l,
uh,so you you know can do some math around that uh look ultimately you know we we ve been pretty consistent,the year and then think about you know primescan and primemill potentially you know it s been interesting tycho even,
uh,re through the worst of covid and things continue to uh improve from here uh yeah good morning listen our our,how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that you know yeah good morning listen our,
uh,of covid and things continue to uh improve from here uh yeah good morning listen our our capital deployment philosophies um,that playing out if you sort of assume that you know yeah good morning listen our capital deployment philosophies are,
uh,um a are not changing have not changed i think uh it was uh absolutely the right thing to uh raise,our capital deployment philosophies are not changing have not changed i think it was absolutely the right thing to raise,
uh,not changing have not changed i think uh it was uh absolutely the right thing to uh raise more liquidity to,philosophies are not changing have not changed i think it was absolutely the right thing to raise more liquidity to,

uh,from a financial standpoint uh we were encouraged actually by uh a number of shareholders to to be in that position,of strength from a financial standpoint we were encouraged actually by a number of shareholders to be in that position,
uh,agree with at this point we want to um keep uh doing what we re doing being very fluent with our,agree with at this point we want to keep doing what we re doing and being very prudent with our,
uh,re doing being very fluent with our balance sheet being uh very diligent with our cash flow uh you probably noticed,re doing and being very prudent with our balance should be very diligent with our cash flow you probably noticed,
uh,balance sheet being uh very diligent with our cash flow uh you probably noticed in the in the second quarter we,prudent with our balance should be very diligent with our cash flow you probably noticed in the second quarter we,
uh,cash flow and um all our parts of our deployment uh will you know are are not changing for now we,yeah good morning listen our capital deployment philosophies are not changing have not changed i think it was absolutely the,
uh,no plans to change our dividend at this time once uh things go back to uh to a more uh normal,office so ultimately if things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back to normal,
uh,dividend at this time once uh things go back to uh to a more uh normal level uh we ll reassess,if things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back to normal okay much appreciated,
uh,once uh things go back to uh to a more uh normal level uh we ll reassess where we are at,to think through that so we re we feel good about where we are from the technology and equipment space,
uh,go back to uh to a more uh normal level uh we ll reassess where we are at that point we,get back to a normal level of sales cross profit was 207 million or 42 1 of sales down from,
uh,at that point we will look at all of the uh demands for capital uh opportunities that we have at that,wonder to what extent you d be willing to talk about growth in germany operating conditions there and to what,
uh,will look at all of the uh demands for capital uh opportunities that we have at that time and uh we,that doesn t get a lot of highlight is that we have a business mis that we had bought a,
uh,capital uh opportunities that we have at that time and uh we ll make uh whatever decisions we think are in,that we re very competitive in the imaging space and now in terms of what do we think about the,
uh,we have at that time and uh we ll make uh whatever decisions we think are in the best interest of,to the fact that we re pushing a little bit faster and we re pushing harder i think the pandemic,
uh,best interest of our shareholders as we deploy that capital uh but for now i think the the focus is on,and longer term to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders further the company has maintained its focus on,
uh,the focus is on o on the recovery is how uh to ensure that we have a very stable financial position,flow if the focus is on the recovery is how to ensure that we have a very stable financial position,

uh,picture question uh the specific one is actually about germany uh i wonder you know to what extent you d be,picture question the specific one is actually about germany i wonder to what extent you d be willing to talk,
uh,willing to talk about growth in germany operating conditions there uh and and to what extent you think that uh a,d be willing to talk about growth in germany operating conditions there and to what extent you think that s,
uh,there uh and and to what extent you think that uh a good barometer for you know what the business might,germany operating conditions there and to what extent you think that s a good barometer for what the business might,
uh,thanks steve um you know conditions in germany are are uh if if you were gonna go around the world are,thanks steve conditions in germany are if you were going to go around the world staff get more used to,
uh,it depends on the business and y y you know uh uh th there s been different reactions to different uh,the dentist in the next six months so you know there s a little bit of a lag there that,
uh,depends on the business and y y you know uh uh th there s been different reactions to different uh different,dentist in the next six months so you know there s a little bit of a lag there that we,
uh,uh uh th there s been different reactions to different uh different businesses and and we kinda look at inaudible together,trevor we haven t seen a huge differentiation between the dsos and the individual practices a little bit of that,
uh,kinda look at inaudible together which is you know germany uh switzerland and and austria uh but but conditions there if,then that s it you know we re not changing ever again so i ve been trying to condition the,
uh,which is you know germany uh switzerland and and austria uh but but conditions there if it if that s a,then that s it you know we re not changing ever again so i ve been trying to condition the,
uh,if it if that s a harbinger of the future uh would would tell you that uh you know things do,do it i think the results here show you that you know we think we ve made some good progress,
uh,harbinger of the future uh would would tell you that uh you know things do get closer to normal i mean,i think the results here show you that you know we think we ve made some good progress i mean,
uh,you know again the same things we see over here uh that we keep tracking is what s office capacity you,the things we re looking at is patient volume and we ve seen that as good office capacity we see,
uh,the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better uh y you know things are better in july than they,they re addressing infection protocols so we see that group as pretty positive one of the things we were trying,
uh,july than they were in june just as as the uh dentist and their staff get more used to that and,in germany are if you were going to go around the world staff get more used to that and then,
uh,staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes uh it s interesting the the uh the patient tracking that,around the world staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes it s interesting the patient tracking that,
uh,and then patient attitudes uh it s interesting the the uh the patient tracking that we did in germany showed uh,and then patient attitudes it s interesting the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know from,
uh,uh the patient tracking that we did in germany showed uh that you know th the from a patient perspective there,s interesting the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know from from a patient perspective there,
uh,the from a patient perspective there was less change in uh germany than there was in the us around uh the,know from from a patient perspective there was less change in germany than there was in the us around the,
uh,in uh germany than there was in the us around uh the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit,change in germany than there was in the us around the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit,
uh,there seems to be a little bit more of a uh stable attitude toward visiting the dentist s office so you,there seems to be a little bit more of a stable attitude toward visiting the dentist office so ultimately if,
uh,things look like germany it points to the fact that uh things do get back to normal okay much appreciated and,things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back to normal okay much appreciated and,
uh,a med tech guy and you came into dental with uh a different perspective on you know what the industry could,medtech guy and you came into dental with a different perspective on you know what the industry could be and,
uh,know over the next you know however many quarters or uh or months and we get to the point where you,like and how practice evolves over the next however many quarters or months and we get to the point where,
uh,in a new post covid normal how is your thinking uh how has your thinking evolved in terms of you know,in a news post covid normal how is your thinking how has your thinking evolved in terms of what you,
uh,business to be what you think the practice looks like uh i know you have a a focus on digital you,business to be what you think the practice looks like i know you have a focus on digital that was,
uh,a focus on digital you know that was there before uh can you just give us a sense for maybe what,focus on digital that was there before can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might have,
uh,and how your thinking has evolved on that future strategic uh vision thank you thanks steve um y you know i,and how your thinking has evolved on that future strategic vision thank you what covid has done is brought into,
uh,has b has brought into sharper focus what i think uh the industry is gonna need to be and uh you,has done is brought into sharper focus what i think the industry is going to need to be and whether,
uh,think uh the industry is gonna need to be and uh you know whether it gets there in two years three,what i think the industry is going to need to be and whether it gets there in two years three,
uh,the first is that you know i i think dsos uh are are going to pick up uh you know i,trends i mean the first is that you know i think dsos are going to pick up you know i,
uh,i think dsos uh are are going to pick up uh you know i don t think it s gonna happen,know i think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think it s going to happen,
uh,the in the immediate short term but i i think uh if if you look at in europe uh and the,think it s going to happen in the immediate short term but i think if you in europe in the,
uh,i think uh if if you look at in europe uh and the us and and even in places in asia,the immediate short term but i think if you in europe in the us and even in places in asia,
uh,in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know sometimes uh some of the offices are are kind of right on,places in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know sometimes some of the offices are kind of right on,
uh,big thing is y you know the the idea of uh when you say digital i i push digital pretty hard,way i think the second big thing is the idea of when you say digital i push digital pretty hard,
uh,when you say digital i i push digital pretty hard uh in in my mind what what i think whether it,the idea of when you say digital i push digital pretty hard in my mind what i think whether it,
uh,be evaluating their practice more critically and i think covid uh brought that into sharp focus that hey look i ve,be evaluating their practice more critically uh allocating time against procedures uh and and how am i thinking about you,
uh,ve got 40 hours to see patients how am i uh allocating time against procedures uh and and and how am,re really going to be evaluating their practice more critically uh allocating time against procedures uh and and how am,
uh,see patients how am i uh allocating time against procedures uh and and and how am i thinking about you know,evaluating their practice more critically uh allocating time against procedures uh and and how am i thinking about you know,
uh,wanna develop within the practice and i m gonna ad uh i m gonna address that accordingly from the equipment and,develop within the practice and i m going to address that accordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize our,
uh,you know our training and and whatnot so you know uh i i think what we ve seen with clear aligners,is that you know i think dsos are going to pick up you know i don t think it s,
uh,what we ve seen with clear aligners is is something uh that s gonna go into the rest of dentistry uh,what we ve seen obviously our margin is revenue dependent and hey look don t think that s going to,
uh,uh that s gonna go into the rest of dentistry uh y you know when you think about implants uh when,in that space are going to be able to deliver for us you know over the next you know a,
uh,dentistry uh y you know when you think about implants uh when you think about even uh basic endo work i,as you keep your medtech hat on and you think about what you want the business to look like and,
uh,you think about implants uh when you think about even uh basic endo work i i think the increased digitization of,so i think you may see a shift that way i think the second big thing is the idea of,
uh,increased digitization of diagnostics and and how that can help uh dentists practice at the highest level of their licenses is,have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so,
uh,going to accelerate so i would i would say steve uh i don t think anything s dramatically changed uh strategically,from the equipment and where i emphasize our training and whatnot i don t think anything has dramatically changed strategically,
uh,steve uh i don t think anything s dramatically changed uh strategically what i think it it s it y you,i emphasize our training and whatnot i don t think anything has dramatically changed strategically what i think is you,
uh,bit slower than what what we saw in med tech uh i think is gonna accelerate pretty dramatically i couldn t,little bit slower than what we saw on medtech i think it s going to accelerate pretty dramatically i couldn,
uh,dramatically i couldn t agree more thanks for all the uh the help here all right thanks steve stay safe thank,pretty dramatically i couldn t agree more thanks for all the help here all right thanks steve stay safe thank,
uh,with william blair please go ahead hi thanks very much uh don curious could you give us an update on the,with william blair please go ahead hi thanks very much don curious could you give us an update on the,
uh,don curious could you give us an update on the uh your integration efforts and uh i i m sure covid,thanks very much don curious could you give us an update on the year integration efforts i m sure covid,
uh,us an update on the uh your integration efforts and uh i i m sure covid has impacted them a little,could you give us an update on the year integration efforts i m sure covid has impacted them a little,
uh,the thinking around them um y y you know john uh first thanks for the question y you know when i,sense about where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has first thanks for the question you know i,
uh,i would say when we outlined things in november of uh 18 you know we kinda said it was a three,would say when we outlined things in november of 18 and we kind of said it was a three year,
uh,a three year program um i i would say that uh and particularly with the announcements we made this morning a,a three year program i would say that and particularly with the announcements we made this morning around traditional ortho,
uh,made this morning a around traditional ortho and analog lab uh i it kind of points to the fact that we,announcements we made this morning around traditional ortho and analog lab it kind of points to the fact that we,
uh,bit faster and we re pushing harder i think the uh pandemic has accelerated our our thinking and um y you,pushing a little bit faster and we re pushing harder i think the pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you,
uh,has accelerated our our thinking and um y you know uh look when you when you see the revenue uh challenges,we re pushing harder i think the pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you know look when you when challenges,
uh,know uh look when you when you see the revenue uh challenges in the second quarter it it also highlights you,pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you know look when you when challenges in the second quarter it also highlights,
uh,that s kind of what i would tell you um uh i i w it it s really interesting internally uh,to get after even faster so that s kind of what i would tell you is really interesting internally uh,
uh,uh i i w it it s really interesting internally uh we keep trying to tell people hey look it s,what i would tell you is really interesting internally uh we keep trying to tell people hey look it s,
uh,gonna get the restructuring done and then that s it uh you know we re not changing ever again so i,to get the restructuring done and then that s it you know we re not changing ever again so i,
uh,organization to understand that this is a marathon and and uh you know the restructuring might have have been only the,trying to condition the organization to understand that this is a marathon and the restructuring might have been only the,
uh,might have have been only the first 10k of that uh so uh look i i i would tell you in,might have been only the first 10k of that so you look specifically hey you know if you thought it,
uh,have been only the first 10k of that uh so uh look i i i would tell you in terms of,have been only the first 10k of that so you look specifically hey you know if you thought it was,
uh,of the plan we laid out we re we re uh more than halfway done um but i would also tell,was a three year restructuring we re slightly ahead of where we thought we would be i would just tell,
uh,than halfway done um but i would also tell you uh b uh you know it s great as i brought,that playing out if you sort of assume that you know yeah good morning listen our capital deployment philosophies are,
uh,done um but i would also tell you uh b uh you know it s great as i brought in a,for us i would say that you know we re starting to get the portfolio where we need to get,
uh,supply chain leader we ve actually now got all the uh commercial people reporting into one pe one person walter peterson,re we re going to go sell you an omni we re going to go sell you a prime and,
uh,commercial people reporting into one pe one person walter peterson uh we re finding more and more stuff that we think,is going to need to be and whether it gets there in two years three years five years i think,
uh,more and more stuff that we think that we can uh improve on that should have y you know r r,s interesting the patient tracking that we did in germany showed that you know from from a patient perspective there,
uh,sirona should be so y you know look specifically hey uh you know if you thought it was a three year,of that so you look specifically hey you know if you thought it was a three year restructuring we re,
uh,re not stopping we re how do we continuously improve uh that s great thanks and and then one last question,re not stopping how do we continuously improve that s great thanks and then one last one implant portfolio performing,
uh,performing how did it do in the second quarter and uh are y are you rethinking that line up at all,performing how did it do in the second quarter and are you rethinking we ve been happy with our implant,
uh,are y are you rethinking that line up at all uh implants is uh you know we ve been happy with,implant portfolio performing how did it do in the second quarter and are you rethinking we ve been happy with,
uh,you rethinking that line up at all uh implants is uh you know we ve been happy with our implant business,you rethinking we ve been happy with our implant business i would tell you when you say the second quarter,
uh,with our implant business um i i would tell you uh y you know when you say the second quarter john,rethinking we ve been happy with our implant business i would tell you when you say the second quarter john,
uh,implants did well relative but you know versus prior year uh y you know across the whole portfolio was challenging um,implants did well relative but versus prior year across the whole portfolio it was challenging as we talk and rethink,
uh,the first of what you ll see a a pretty uh regular set of introductions over the next 18 months in,first of what you ll see a pretty regular set of introductions over the next 18 months in our implant,

uh,products uh in that space are gonna be able to uh deliver for us you know over the next you know,in that space are going to be able to deliver for us you know over the next you know a,
uh,question is from jon block with stifel please go ahead uh this is trevor on for jon thanks for taking my,is from john block with stiefel please go ahead hi this is trevor rohn for john thanks for taking my,
uh,earlier that your patient tracking is saying that y con uh patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently i,our patient tracking is telling us that confidence in the dentist s office continues to go up pocket that s,
uh,we re doing patient tracking a across the entire globe uh and and again we we ve seen consistent improvement a,we re doing patient tracking across the entire globe and again we ve seen consistent improvement around people likely to,
uh,know whether it s you know adjusting waiting room or uh you know how they re addressing infection protocols so we,know whether it s you know adjusting waiting room or you know how they re addressing infection protocols so we,
uh,you know look i i and and by the way uh while most of the patient data is good there is,see that so you know look and by the way while most of the patient data is good there is,
uh,bit of a lag there um that that we see uh particularly in the us but we don t see it,bit of a lag there that we see at elsewhere around the world so patient tracking has been actually a,
uh,particularly in the us but we don t see it uh else elsewhere around the world so patient patient tracking has,s a little bit of a lag there that we see at elsewhere around the world so patient tracking has,
uh,you think that um you know some of the smaller uh more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up there,and if you think that some of the smaller more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up as well,
uh,t seen a a a a huge differentiation between the uh the dsos and and the individual practices you know the,t seen a huge differentiation between the dsos and the individual practices a little bit of that but we haven,
uh,s 600 000 dentists ar around the world um and uh and they re independent business owners and they re a,m not going to say it s going to be revenue independent but we think we can take steps at,
uh,reaching out to their patients and whatnot so i i uh look do i think on the margin if if somebody,emphasize our training and whatnot i don t think anything has dramatically changed strategically what i think is you know,
uh,now maybe is the time that i accelerate that yeah uh you you might see a little bit of that but,go back to the dentist in the next six months so you know there s a little bit of a,
uh,of that but you know we haven t seen a uh a sharp change in the number of dental practices that,of that but we haven t seen a sharp change in the number of dental practices great thank you so,
uh,doing business with and y you know we think that uh we we haven t seen a drop off in the,dsos and the individual practices a little bit of that but we haven t seen a sharp change in the,

uh,and dosing regimen um first of all i think that uh signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or,and dosing regimens first of all i think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily first and,
uh,eye disease are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones uh i do not believe that certainly in the case of,think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily first and foremost regulatory milestones you re thinking of,
uh,i wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth uh instead we view signs and i think most patients and,forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes despite number of patients coming,
uh,think most patients and physicians view signs as regulatory um uh milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with,in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for raproxilab in general in terms i m established with,
uh,important um in this case for one to two doses uh day the one to two day dosing paradigm you re,for the rast trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the,
uh,28 day dosing paradigm i would expect we would dose uh q i d which is the first phase of our,for the 28 day dosing paradigm i would expect we would dose qid which is the first phase of our,

uh,established with the release of the phase iii renew trial uh back in uh uh december in terms of how physicians,which was established with the release of the phase 3 renew trial back in december in terms of how physicians,

uh,physicians look at the dosing paradigm for reproxalap in general uh in terms of treating patients i think that uh the,in december in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm for raproxilab in general in terms i m,
uh,general uh in terms of treating patients i think that uh the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew over 12 weeks,physicians look at the dosing paradigm for raproxilab in general in terms i m established with renew over 12 weeks,
uh,the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew over 12 weeks uh r really sets the tone a and and more precisely,in general in terms i m established with renew over 12 weeks really sets the tone and more precisely the,
uh,for how the drug will be used and that is uh a q i d dosing initially uh followed by b,for how the drug will be used and that is a qid dosing initially followed by bid dosing for the,
uh,and that is uh a q i d dosing initially uh followed by b i d dosing uh for the maintenance,how the drug will be used and that is a qid dosing initially followed by bid dosing for the maintenance,
uh,d dosing initially uh followed by b i d dosing uh for the maintenance phase okay that s really helpful um,qid dosing initially followed by bid dosing for the maintenance phase okay that s really helpful maybe just a clarification,
uh,know in the press release it says that there s uh gonna be a dry eye nda filing um by the,clarification question i know in the press week that there s going to be a dry nda filing by the,
uh,will be filed together pending positive clinical data of course uh it turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease,will be filed together pending positive clinical data of course it turns out that the timelines for dry eye disease,
uh,the mda m nda all of those seem to overlap uh for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point uh,the nda all of those seem to overlap for dry eye and alert and conjunctivitis at this point would suggest,
uh,uh for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point uh which suggests that a concurrent nda is perhaps the best,for dry eye and alert and conjunctivitis at this point would suggest that a concurrent nda is perhaps the best,
uh,ll have to see how um events play out um uh over the latter part of this year and the early,course we ll have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year in the early,
uh,year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of uh concurrent nda we really do like the concurrent nda paradigm,before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent nda we really do like the concurrent nda paradigm,
uh,both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to to uh physicians but also to patients as well right great that,is indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous to positions but also to patients as well right that makes,
uh,a lot of sense um my last question is just uh you know on the safety study is there an expectation,well right that makes a lot of sense my last question is just on the safety study however based on,
uh,is there an expectation for what the size and scope uh you know duration as well as number of patients you,simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes despite number of patients coming in was diminished during that,
uh,fda generally requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing uh however um uh based on um other res other sponsors,last question is just on the safety study however based on other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that,
uh,100 patients complete one year of dosing uh however um uh based on um other res other sponsors interactions with the,question is just on the safety study however based on other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that we,

uh,scott and good morning everyone and appreciate everyone s attendance uh for your call today thanks for making time to join,we appreciate everybody joining us and you know we ll continue to update as we need to and we ll,
uh,some of the key factors first as much of our uh peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions,to some of the savings we articulated last quarter we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing,
uh,our 2020 drilling program in late may and released our uh contracted rig operating in the mid midland basin so our,our 2020 drilling program in late may and released our contracted rig operating in the midland basin are minimal for,
uh,have entered the second half of this year with expectations uh for no further drilling or completion activities this year we,we have entered the second half of this year with expectations for no further drilling or completion activity this year,
uh,reduce our working capital deficit which we calculate excluding derivatives uh and we re able to do this by well over,where that working capital deficit is pretty low and probably won t fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the,
uh,really any and everywhere including reduced usage of third par uh third party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs,reducing expenses really any and everywhere including reduced uses of third party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs,

uh,online with that i ll turn back over the robert uh thank you mark we are really pleased with the results,one then robert can add on if he wants to you know we keep things pretty simple at the end,
uh,pleased with the results and confident in a bright future uh for earthstone while we are sorry to see our industry,no matter where we are in the cycle so i think we re just going to see more and more,
uh,about the 2021 plan um as we said here today uh yes laugh a little bit of both brad um you,as we sit here today okay good and then obviously you made a comment on m a can you go,
uh,to spending large capital dollars um but outside of that uh at some point end of this year early next year,you know i was thinking about having the back inventory where it works out that just completing those next year,
uh,and then obviously you made the comment on m a uh can you go into a little more detail about sort,good and then obviously you made a comment on m a can you go into a little more detail about,
uh,acquisitions and much like we ve done in our fr uh history you know we ll bring in parties at the,that one then robert can add on if he wants to you know we keep things pretty simple at the,
uh,other memberships i just know what else is there laugh uh yes there s no country club memberships uh up here,there s just kind of which one of those is more important for us to use as we you know,
uh,there laugh uh yes there s no country club memberships uh up here um you know e e the the the,that when the second quarter and imax prices were about up to the lowest point the head realizations also include,
uh,wells we have are in really good areas and they uh they will help us keep production relatively flat at 30,we re not spending any drilling capital these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat about sort of pdp,
uh,you know we still have a relatively high decline rate uh and it does depend on when we brought those wells,they still have a lot of issues to deal with it and obviously there s been a lot of e,
uh,production from these new wells so um you know maintenance uh eh to maintain you know 13 000 boe a day,production flat about sort of pdp decline you know on a go for it is now that you ve been,
uh,of your thinking about that in 21 on broader terms uh yeah i think we ve been consistent in telling everyone,the months of april and may i think at the end of the day it s still not a very,
uh,in the first year and then gets into the mid uh maybe 26 or 27 the next year and then low,in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year all right thank you thank you our next,
uh,then low 20s or high teens after that and so uh you know i don t think that s changed any,a caller on how you know kind of you re you know i don t think that s changed any,
uh,you know i don t think that s changed any uh and if we didn t spend any capital then you,you know i don t think that s changed any and if we didn t spend any capital then you,
uh,of forecast what our blowdown um production would look like uh even if we didn t do those 11 wells but,of forecast what our blow down production would look like even if we didn t do those 11 wells again,
uh,proceed with your question hi guys um i was wondering uh robert or or maybe mark how important to you guys,proceed with your question it could help you know if the returns were good and it would help panf jumpstart,
uh,of comfort with any you know near medium term outspend uh if it helps you know if the returns are good,grant with northland capital markets please proceed with your question it could help you know if the returns were good,
uh,you definitely could go complete the ducts right now and uh have pretty nice uh rrs for the incremental cost to,economically you definitely could go complete the ducks right now and have pretty nice irrs for the incremental cost to,
uh,complete the ducts right now and uh have pretty nice uh rrs for the incremental cost to complete them um i,complete the ducks right now and have pretty nice irrs for the incremental cost to complete them in terms of,
uh,we we do anticipate picking the rig back up and uh you know there s a bit of a a obviously,else that happens with prices if all we re doing is completing the docs there s a bit of obviously,
uh,the well head that will flow into the bigger picture uh and having some outspend for some period of time um,the wellhead that will flow into the first thing i ll add jeff is i think we can run a,
uh,um yeah we still think is supported by the economics uh at the same time y y you know we re,work through that and that will definitely help reduce loe and then some of the things that you know quarter,
uh,time but i think longer term over a year timeframe uh a again depending on what the price is sure understood,time i think longer term over a year time frame again depending on what the price is sure understood appreciate,
uh,know a a decent amount of of non op exposure uh in the permian are you guys seeing any activity levels,guys still have a decent amount of non off exposure in the permian are you guys seeing any activity levels,
uh,the land side um is there any traction or conversations uh on swapping any of that out to increase the operation,are you guys seeing any activity levels there and conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operation,
uh,increase the operation exposure there still working on the trades uh but people have been hunkered down in the bunker i,increase the operation exposure there still working on the trade but people have been hunkered down in the bunker you,
uh,march um and so nothing s moving very quickly there uh we have no we have not heard anything different from,least march and so nothing s moving very quickly there we have no we have not heard anything different from,
uh,our partners in terms of activity in the near term uh being kind of the remainder of this year so we,our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year all right,
uh,with your question morning robert oh morning i had a uh quick question inaudible on the balance sheet now y all,good morning robert good morning check i had a quick question over on the balance sheet you know you all,
uh,them to give you an any indication as to what uh the fall redetermination could could look like sh sure um,you know if you ve been in conversations with the bank as we head into the fall redetermination you know,
uh,probably too early to you know inaudible anything around numbers uh but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we,but you know back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall and it s,
uh,better now than it did three months ago a absolutely uh and and maybe some of that s the shock of,environment feel better now than it did three months ago absolutely and maybe some of that s the shock of,
uh,the shock of seeing minus 37 dollar on oil and uh you know seeing realizations for for the month of of,the shock of seeing minus 37 hour oil and you know teeing realizations for the months of april and may,
uh,some some really good inaudible and y all did some uh pretty creative things to get loe down um in the,in april and very low forecasted may oil prices we made the decision in late april to shut in the,
uh,could can carry forward um to kinda help mitigate that uh loe curve uh definitely dun there there s you know,that you can carry forward to kind of help mitigate that total decrease definitely done and it s just a,
uh,forward um to kinda help mitigate that uh loe curve uh definitely dun there there s you know it s just,think that you can carry forward to kind of help mitigate that total decrease definitely done and it s just,
uh,a constant progression of a well s lifecycle to adjust uh artificial lift uh a lot of our wells are on,just a constant progression of a well s life cycle to adjust artificial lift a lot of our wells are,

uh,wells are on uh gas lift so relatively expensive compressors uh over time that gets changed out to other lift methods,our wells are on gas lift so relatively expensive compressors over time that gets changed out to other lift methods,
uh,then some of the things that you know we we uh were fortunate in getting done in the quarter uh working,through that and that will definitely help reduce loe and then some of the things that you know quarter working,
uh,we uh were fortunate in getting done in the quarter uh working with the utility company to get meters set and,and then some of the things that you know quarter working with the utility company to get meters set and,
uh,moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we uh we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and,moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those,
uh,some of these things we did in the second quarter uh are sustainable and we ll continue doing the right things,some of these things we did in the second quarter are sustainable and we ll continue doing the right things,

uh,and opec russia or or was um w was that uh sort of part of the plan as you were just,it that we you know and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and you re just,
uh,to to emphasis on free cashflow heading into next year uh i d love to tell you noel that we had,to quarter year to year free cash flow that we won t outspend no we re not and from a,
uh,the beginning of the year and the call we had uh you know related to the fourth quarter earnings and full,the beginning of the year and the call we had you know related to the fourth quarter earnings in full,
uh,cashflow um and those 11 wells would ve been completed uh i don t know by know i can t remember,flow and those 11 wells would have been completed i don t know if by now i can t remember,
uh,say it s a fallout of what s happened here uh and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures an,so it s a fallout of what s happened here and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures and,
uh,we come out of this down this near term down uh cycle we ve been in a down cycle since 2014,and making sure that we come out of this near term down cycle been in a down cycle since 2014,
uh,a down cycle since 2014 but at least this recent uh piece of it uh that we you know we survive,been in a down cycle since 2014 but at least this recent piece of it that we you know and,
uh,2014 but at least this recent uh piece of it uh that we you know we survive nicely through it and,2014 but at least this recent piece of it that we you know and continue to find ways to consolidate,
uh,come out the other side and um can continue to uh find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and y,we you know and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and you re just a housekeeping,
uh,i guess i d say cash capex and you know uh sort of capex incurred in the quarter and i was,if i looked at the numbers right it looked like this is one incurred in the quarter and i was,
uh,proxy for your really sort of cashflow for the period uh we back out interest expense and then we back out,for a really sort of cash flow for the period we back out interest expense and then we back out,
uh,working capital deficit by about 50 million during the quarter uh now we re to a point where that working deficit,up and the reason for that is because and of course this is a point where that working capital deficit,
uh,way or the other until we pick activity back up uh at which point you d expect uh you know if,one way or the other until we pick activity back up at which point you d expect yeah if you,
uh,activity back up uh at which point you d expect uh you know if you start completions and drilling again you,activity back up at which point you d expect yeah if you start completions and drilling again you start getting,

uh,dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by uh oral surgeons and dentists that us use iv opioids and,number of dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by oral surgeons and dentists that use iv opioids,
uh,been working with various specialists around the country su sure uh dsuvia is being used uh in um ambulatory surgery settings,d souva can be addressing very specialist around the country sure dysuvia is being used in ambulatory surgery settings it,
uh,around the country su sure uh dsuvia is being used uh in um ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in,addressing very specialist around the country sure dysuvia is being used in ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in,
uh,of dsuvia use um in short term settings also in uh some interesting medically supervised settings such as fertility clinics which,we re seeing a lot of disuvia use in short term settings also some interesting medically it s not setting,
uh,settings such as fertility clinics which often have to do uh painful procedures and currently use iv opioids in that setting,that avoids them having to stop their procedure and re dose their iv opioids which they typically have to do,
uh,each of those different areas pam can you also comment uh briefly on how you re seeing dsuvia used in the,each of those different areas pam can you also comment briefly on how you re seeing dysuvia used in their,
uh,timing of the dose and why yeah the majority of uh folks using dsuvia now are giving it a preoperative of,where are you seeing use in dutuvia and any new areas during the quarter placing orders or seeing use of,
uh,a preoperative of about 15 to 20 minutes prior to uh incision as they know it takes uh 15 minutes to,for me i promise again the sublingual route of administration avoids the first path effect meaning it doesn t go,
uh,minutes prior to uh incision as they know it takes uh 15 minutes to reach that sort of therapeutic concentration and,they know the benefit that it s can use evan just to reiterate why go with zimmer and we mentioned,
uh,15 minutes to reach that sort of therapeutic concentration and uh 90 to 95 of the time they re using just,don t have any cognitive impairment and that s a huge part so one of the things we re hearing,
uh,of the time they re using just a single dose uh we know from our pk as well as our clinical,to discharge with just that single dose on the messages we ve communicated that onset the duration and as doctors,
uh,early we ve not really had a definitive framework from uh the fda yet on their evaluation of uh new opioid,early not really had a definitive framework from the fda yet on their evaluation of new opioid products it s,

uh,the dap division on uh on a specified framework to uh you know sort of evaluate new opioid submissions think the,fda and specifically of adapt division on a specified framework to sort of evaluate new opioid submissions i think the,
uh,just in terms of the feedback you ve received from uh physicians using the product um is the onset of action,something else just in terms of the feedback you received from physicians using the product is the onset of action,
uh,interesting it s actually a little bit longer um than uh you know our clinical trial we did not have a,the duration of action is interesting actually a little bit longer than our clinical trial we did not have a,
uh,that the duration of analgesia it can even last beyond uh the three to four hours and has a very nice,that the duration of analgesia can even last beyond the three to four hours and it has a very nice,
uh,um time to discharge is sort of a composite measure uh you have to have your adverse events under control and,analgesia through to discharge with just that single dose on the messages we ve communicated that onset the duration and,
uh,from the typical iv injectable opioids that they re often uh seeing brandon very helpful hope that helps crosstalk thank you,for the iv injectable clear liquid opioids with just a single dose and i reiterate beyond what pam said we,
uh,come from michael higgins of ladenburg thalmann please go ahead uh my questions have been asked thanks thank you our next,come from michael higgins of leidenberg salmon please go ahead my questions have been asked thank you our next question,
uh,they saw the obvious benefits um they we are only uh brand certifying and supplying it to oral surgeons and iv,they saw the obvious benefits a duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop their procedure and re dose,
uh,depression due to opioids so these are very savvy surgeons uh who already know how to use iv opioids and they,dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by oral surgeons and dentists that use iv opioids and we,
uh,they clearly see the benefit and that s again why uh you know zimmer saw the benefit as well um they,they know the benefit that it s can use evan just to reiterate why go with zimmer and we mentioned,
uh,use yeah evan just to just to reiterate why why uh go with uh zimmer and and we mentioned that these,use evan just to reiterate why go with zimmer and we mentioned these other specialty markets large markets but we,

uh,for cancer patients it is through the combined effort of uh all of you that keeps us on the path of,for each milestone payment that d be helpful for us thanks maybe i take the question on the pathway and,
uh,all of you that keeps us on the path of uh discovery and innovation uh i m now happy to close,clinical sites the patients and all their families and our investors who are supporting i m now happy to close,
uh,keeps us on the path of uh discovery and innovation uh i m now happy to close the presentation and we,and our investors who are supporting i m now happy to close the presentation and we re open now for,
uh,ahead your line is now open hi good morning everyone uh congrats on the progress and uh thanks for taking my,ahead your line is now open hi good morning everyone that s under progress and thanks for taking my questions,
uh,hi good morning everyone uh congrats on the progress and uh thanks for taking my questions um to start off just,hi good morning everyone that s under progress and thanks for taking my questions to start off just wondering for,
uh,have been dosed and um if you can talk more uh about the the timing of dosing between patients with the,patients in have been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients and with,
uh,pace going forward andreas can you take the question please uh yeah so there there will there were multiple parts of,about enrollment pace going forward andreas can you take the question please yeah yeah so there were multiple parts to,
uh,one study afm 24 um as we said we are uh recruiting in the second cohort um we have not yet,one study of afm 24 as we said we are recruiting into second cohort be treated all at the same,
uh,many patients um but you know it s a standard uh three by three design um with with a inaudible uh,complete details on the exact milestone payments but you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we,
uh,uh three by three design um with with a inaudible uh dose modification uh but what that s basically what it,to the acr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that that quickly went,
uh,three design um with with a inaudible uh dose modification uh but what that s basically what it is um in,the dosing a kind of moderate peak that that quickly went down was completely resolved without any treatment obviously one,
uh,it is um in terms of timing between the patients uh there is a mandatory eight day waiting period uh between,and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients and with the four sites activated can,
uh,patients uh there is a mandatory eight day waiting period uh between patients uh so they cannot be treated all at,patients in have been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients and with,
uh,is a mandatory eight day waiting period uh between patients uh so they cannot be treated all at the same time,of afm 24 as we said we are recruiting into second cohort be treated all at the same time but,
uh,just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about uh enrollment pace going forward uh yeah currently the enrollment uh,i m just wondering if you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah pace is as,
uh,provide any more perspective about uh enrollment pace going forward uh yeah currently the enrollment uh pace is uh as pre,provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah pace is as pre spressified by the protocol so all,
uh,uh enrollment pace going forward uh yeah currently the enrollment uh pace is uh as pre specified by the protocol uh,you can provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah pace is as pre spressified by the protocol,
uh,going forward uh yeah currently the enrollment uh pace is uh as pre specified by the protocol uh so all sites,any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward yeah pace is as pre spressified by the protocol so all sites,
uh,uh pace is uh as pre specified by the protocol uh so all sites are very active in screening patients and,forward yeah pace is as pre spressified by the protocol so all sites are very active in screening patients and,
uh,and combo plans at this point um so for the uh tumor types uh in the does escalation part uh we,you know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we,
uh,at this point um so for the uh tumor types uh in the does escalation part uh we are accepting all,ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre,
uh,the uh tumor types uh in the does escalation part uh we are accepting all uh patients with all all histologies,to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on,
uh,in the does escalation part uh we are accepting all uh patients with all all histologies that are egfr expressing and,patients and as we said all sites have already contributed patients got it okay histologies that are ejfr expressing and,
uh,patients with all all histologies that are egfr expressing and uh where the patient has exhausted the respected standard of care,patients got it okay histologies that are ejfr expressing and where the patient has exhausted the respective standard of care,
uh,adi mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors uh probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cancer,and there is a variety of options to look at this is what we do not only from our side,
uh,be colorectal cancer and non small cell lung cancer and uh these are the two hist ologies where we would expect,on top we can receive royalties which as we described are on the higher end of what you would expect,
uh,expect probably the majority of patients in the phase one uh having said that uh the dose escalation part would uh,the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a,
uh,of patients in the phase one uh having said that uh the dose escalation part would uh also be open for,where the patient has exhausted the respective standard of care treatments the dose escalation part would also be open for,
uh,uh having said that uh the dose escalation part would uh also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like uh,the respective standard of care treatments the dose escalation part would also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like,
uh,uh also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like uh for example head and neck cancer gastric cancer or or,would also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like for current in the process of being defined now for,
uh,other solid tumors now once we have defined our dose uh limiting toxicities or if there are no does limiting toxicities,or we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation study without any dose limiting toxicities,
uh,does limiting toxicities we have defined recommend phase two dose uh we will enroll into uh tumor specific expansion cohorts um,have the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the dose cohort expansion but as we,
uh,defined recommend phase two dose uh we will enroll into uh tumor specific expansion cohorts um and these expansion cohorts are,the recommended phase two dose coming up in order to then do the dose cohort expansion but as we ve,
uh,1 in combination with afm13 which aren t referred to uh with the uh very encouraging complete response rate uh in,still the safety to be determined and obviously in combination we will learn more on the functionalities so this is,
uh,with afm13 which aren t referred to uh with the uh very encouraging complete response rate uh in excess of 40,with an overall response impressive overall response rate of 88 with a complete response rate of 42 and 46 in,
uh,to uh with the uh very encouraging complete response rate uh in excess of 40 uh we plan to have a,of 88 with a complete response rate of 42 and 46 in the the local and the central read respectively,
uh,very encouraging complete response rate uh in excess of 40 uh we plan to have a combination with the pd 1,overall response impressive overall response rate of 88 with a complete response rate of 42 and 46 in the the,
uh,1 or a pdl 1 inhibitor open rather soon probably uh in parallel to the last cohort of the dose escalation,as soon as the situation improves or we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation,
uh,our next question next question comes from the line of uh jim unk from los unk please go ahead jim yeah,to the next question next question comes from the line of jim breschenoff from wells fargo please go ahead jim,
uh,progress um maybe just a first quick question for angus uh to start him off collaborative research revenues is that expected,on all the progress maybe just a first quick question for angus to start him you know our revenue numbers,
uh,and that ll give us some sense of the milestone uh given that you can t say it explicitly yeah yeah,milestone payments that we receive so you know this milestone payment that we discussed today that we ll get in,
uh,you know fairly fairly range range bound and costs us uh 2 million to 5 million zone you know when see,ve been fairly range found and call it the 2 million to 5 million zone you know when you see,
uh,cells to the tumor site yeah um so in the uh dose escalation part um we do a pre treatment biopsy,recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy,
uh,dose escalation part um we do a pre treatment biopsy uh post or on treatment biopsies are optional uh we do,the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have,
uh,treatment biopsy uh post or on treatment biopsies are optional uh we do have uh significant correlative science program looking at,treatment biopsy post or on treatment biopsies are optional we do have a significant correlative science program looking at peripheral,

uh,we do have uh significant correlative science program looking at uh peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as um,optional we do have a significant correlative science program looking at peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as,
uh,of nk cells as well as um a cytokine profiles uh once we are in the expansion of phase so we,activation markers of nk cells as well as on cytokine profiles once we are in the expansion phase so we,
uh,are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts i think this is uh the part where we will get most of the correlative,are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts i think this is the part where we will get most of the correlative,
uh,the correlative science as we have more homogenous patient population uh we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and,of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous and biopsies in selected cohorts and then just given the,
uh,we maintain our requirement for a pre treatment biopsy and uh will have post or on treatment biopsies in selected cohorts,so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on treatment biopsies are optional we,
uh,given the comments on the variability in peripheral nk cell uh populations um is there any sense in screening patients for,given the comments on the variability in peripheral nk cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their,
uh,treatment and it s not worth screening for that variable uh i think currently it would be uh premature it depends,effective treatment and it s not worth screening for that variable i think currently it would be premature to depends,
uh,for that variable uh i think currently it would be uh premature it depends on what you mean with with screening,worth screening for that variable i think currently it would be premature to depends on what you mean with screening,
uh,mean with with screening so we are definitely determining the uh levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some,with screening so we are definitely determining the levels of search lating nk cells and also looking at some of,
uh,or a threshold and this may very well vary between uh tumor hist ologies and also be dependent on uh the,as we said all sites have already contributed patients got it okay histologies that are ejfr expressing and where the,
uh,between uh tumor hist ologies and also be dependent on uh the inaudible of nk cells in the tumor microenvironment uh,dependent with 8 and 13 we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different any,
uh,uh the inaudible of nk cells in the tumor microenvironment uh the variable which we have seen in our afm13 uh,within the variability of an eight cell in the blood that you ll be able to have an effective treatment,
uh,uh the variable which we have seen in our afm13 uh columbia study to have some impact on on the likelihood,where we have an active ind for our first phase one study of afm 13 in in combination with allogeneic,
uh,i andreas why don t you go ahead laugh okay uh yeah you re right core blood derived nk cells is,well andreas why don t you go ahead ok you re right quad blood derived nk cells is one source,
uh,cells is one source of nk cells and if you uh watch the field of nk cell um based approached especially,nk cells is one source of nk cells and if you watch the field of nk cell based approaches of,
uh,um providing different sources of nk cells there is definitely uh speed picking up and uh there is a variety of,of nk cell based approaches of nk cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of,
uh,nk cells there is definitely uh speed picking up and uh there is a variety of of options to to look,based approaches of nk cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of options to look,
uh,not only from our site but we have also received uh proactive inquiries of uh potential um working models to gather,what we do not only from our side but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models together,
uh,site but we have also received uh proactive inquiries of uh potential um working models to gather so we are looking,side but we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models together and so we see this cobalt derived,
uh,to gather so we are looking at the entire nk uh cell field and then evaluating various options there great thanks,of nk cells there is definitely speed picking up and there is a variety of options to look at this,
uh,quite advanced and chemically relevant so they have already been uh many patients well with ipsc currently um there is still,and so there have already been many patients treated while with the ipses currently there is still the safety to,
uh,is still a um the inaudible to be determined and uh obviously in combination with learning more on the functionalities so,currently there is still the safety to be determined and obviously in combination we will learn more on the functionalities,
uh,combination with learning more on the functionalities so this is uh somewhat uh in uh to us on how functional an,obviously in combination we will learn more on the functionalities so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional,
uh,learning more on the functionalities so this is uh somewhat uh in uh to us on how functional an ipsc derived,we will learn more on the functionalities so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional and it s,
uh,on the functionalities so this is uh somewhat uh in uh to us on how functional an ipsc derived versus a,on the functionalities so this is somewhat yet to us on how functional and it s good to see the,
uh,to see the first clinical data so we re quite uh uh not only happy but we ve we ve checked,to see the first clinical data so we re quite not only happy but we ve checked so many different,
uh,see the first clinical data so we re quite uh uh not only happy but we ve we ve checked so,see the first clinical data so we re quite not only happy but we ve checked so many different options,
uh,for nk cells and we are indeed very convinced about uh the activity of the core blood derived cells from uh,for in case cells and we re indeed very convinced about the activity of the corporectal ractals from md anderson,
uh,uh the activity of the core blood derived cells from uh md anderson great thanks adi thank you our next question,indeed very convinced about the activity of the corporectal ractals from md anderson great thanks adi thank you the line,
uh,taking my questions this is e k allen for unk uh just a couple regarding the bcma engager um i understand,taking my question this is e k allen for doe kim just a couple regarding the bcma and the engager,
uh,this ability on the entirety of the clinical developed pathway uh but if you could provide any type of insight in,limited visibility on the entirety of the clinical bill pathway but if you can provide any type of insight but,
uh,provide any type of insight in terms of what genentech uh kind of has planned maybe in terms of could they,provide any type of insight but genentech kind of has planned maybe in terms of could it potentially pursue an,
uh,pursue an accelerated pathway um for the assets and secondly uh again you re you don t provide uh complete details,of could it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don t provide complete details,
uh,and secondly uh again you re you don t provide uh complete details on the exact milestone payments but if you,pathway for the assets and secondly again you don t provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but you,
uh,provide us some additional perspective on what the future milestones uh for the asset might hold um in terms of uh,provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but you know phase two phase three things of that sort should,
uh,uh for the asset might hold um in terms of uh you know phase two phase three things of that sort,t provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but you know phase two phase three things of that sort,
uh,you know phase two phase three things of that sort uh should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone,you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we expect increasing size of value for each milestone,
uh,we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payment uh that would be helpful for us thanks adi maybe i,we expect increasing size of value for each milestone payment that d be helpful for us thanks maybe i take,
uh,at the poster just to review again the very strong uh pre clinical cell killing selective no cytokine release very good,at acr at the poster just to review again a very strong preclinical cell killing selective no sodic endemic marker,
uh,very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific bcma uh specific plasma cell killing in the cyno monkey so you,again a very strong preclinical cell killing selective no sodic endemic marker specific bcma plasma cell killing in the synomunccy,
uh,it s it s a it s a clearly um uh strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will,i leave it there i think it s a clearly strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will,
uh,clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable uh genentech and we as we are partnered to you know,clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable genetic and we as their partner to have strong position,
uh,to you know have a strong position in the space uh yeah regarding the financials so uh i just wanna recall,and we as their partner to have strong position in the space regarding the financials i just want to recall,
uh,position in the space uh yeah regarding the financials so uh i just wanna recall the deal uh when it was,to have strong position in the space regarding the financials i just want to recall the deal when it was,
uh,the financials so uh i just wanna recall the deal uh when it was signed so we received 96 million in,regarding the financials i just want to recall the deal when it was signed so we received 96 million in,
uh,signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and uh a uh and can get the total of uh more,deal when it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and can get a total of more,
uh,we received 96 million in upfront cash and uh a uh and can get the total of uh more than 5,it was signed so we received 96 million in upfront cash and can get a total of more than 5,
uh,and uh a uh and can get the total of uh more than 5 billion in milestones that uh are d,cash and can get a total of more than 5 billion in milestones that in different categories so there s,
uh,total of uh more than 5 billion in milestones that uh are d different categories so there are uh preclin there,total of more than 5 billion in milestones that in different categories so there s a pre technical milestone payment,
uh,milestones that uh are d different categories so there are uh preclin there s a pre clinical milestones payments there are,milestones that in different categories so there s a pre technical milestone payment there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments,

uh,uh usually that s just a general statement that s uh that the payments will increase the further the program progresses,so usually and that s just a general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses,
uh,thank you for that and just one more quick questions uh i think i might have misheard it this is in,thank you for that and just one more quick question i think i might have misheard it and this is,
uh,might have misheard it this is in regards to afm24 uh i believe you mentioned that there was a patient uh,might have misheard it and this is in regards to afm 24 i believe you mentioned that there was a,
uh,uh i believe you mentioned that there was a patient uh that had increased il6 cytokine levels that would resolve over,believe you mentioned that there was a patient that had increased in all six cytokine levels that would resolve over,
uh,increased il6 cytokine levels that would resolve over 24 hours uh just curious was that self resolving or was that did,increased in all six cytokine levels that would resolve over 24 hours just curious was that self resolving or did,
uh,self resolving or was that did that patient receive and uh il6 inhibitor yeah i can thanks for bringing that up,curious was that self resolving or did that patient receive an al6 inhibitor yeah i can thanks for bringing that,
uh,thanks for bringing that up for verification so the transient uh il6 increase was reported in the inaudible enabling cyno tox,i can thanks for bringing that up and the clarification so the transient al6 increase was reported in the eynine,
uh,of moderate peak that quickly went down was completely resolved uh without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn t,dosing a kind of moderate peak that that quickly went down was completely resolved without any treatment obviously one doesn,
uh,patients that um we should not expect any kind of uh cytokine release uh syndrome all right thank you for that,course will be looked at carefully in patients that any kind of cytokine release syndrome okay thank you for that,
uh,we should not expect any kind of uh cytokine release uh syndrome all right thank you for that clarification sure and,looked at carefully in patients that any kind of cytokine release syndrome okay thank you for that clarification sure thank,
uh,open hello yes hi can you hear hi yes sorry uh my headset fall out uh thanks for taking the questions,open hello yes hello hi can you hear you hi sorry that s my headset spot out is that for,
uh,you hear hi yes sorry uh my headset fall out uh thanks for taking the questions my first question is that,you hear you hi sorry that s my headset spot out is that for the afm 13 for the registration,
uh,my first question is that for the afm13 in the uh for the registration study that uh it s assignment to,out is that for the afm 13 for the registration study that it s a simon 2 setup so what,
uh,the afm13 in the uh for the registration study that uh it s assignment to uh setup so uh what might,for the afm 13 for the registration study that it s a simon 2 setup so what might be the,
uh,for the registration study that uh it s assignment to uh setup so uh what might be the threshold of inaudible,the afm 13 for the registration study that it s a simon 2 setup so what might be the threshold,
uh,study that uh it s assignment to uh setup so uh what might be the threshold of inaudible in the 40,study that it s a simon 2 setup so what might be the threshold of orr in the 4d patient,
uh,just curious to what inaudible and review on that front uh i m afraid we cannot give a uh concrete response,is going to reveal on that front now i m afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate it s,
uh,that front uh i m afraid we cannot give a uh concrete response rate it s based also on the patient,on that front now i m afraid we cannot give a concrete response rate it s based also on the,
uh,design so there is some interdependence of response rates but uh we usually do not disclose thresholds but it s a,bayesian design so there are some interdependence of response rates but we usually do not disclose thresholds but it s,
uh,and and also just curious in terms of afm24 that uh you are dose escalating uh at least based on uh,ok no problem and also just curious in terms of afm 24 that your dose escalating but at least based,
uh,in terms of afm24 that uh you are dose escalating uh at least based on uh interim data is there any,in terms of afm 24 that your dose escalating but at least based start to see the potential effective dose,
uh,uh you are dose escalating uh at least based on uh interim data is there any thought where when you might,that your dose escalating but at least based start to see the potential effective dose to start i think currently,
uh,might start to see the potential effective dose to start uh i think currently it s not possible to predict uh,start to see the potential effective dose to start i think currently it s not possible to predict when we,
uh,uh i think currently it s not possible to predict uh when we will have the optimal uh biologically active dose,to start i think currently it s not possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose,
uh,possible to predict uh when we will have the optimal uh biologically active dose um as there are a number of,possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose as there are a number of covariance like,
uh,there s only a tox species of the cynomolgus monkey uh however we do not have any uh cynomolgus monkey tumor,that that s only a talk species is the synomorgous monkey however we do not have any synomorgous monkey tumor,
uh,the cynomolgus monkey uh however we do not have any uh cynomolgus monkey tumor models available so uh we cannot really,species is the synomorgous monkey however we do not have any synomorgous monkey tumor models available so we cannot really,
uh,not have any uh cynomolgus monkey tumor models available so uh we cannot really bridge between uh what we see in,not have any synomorgous monkey tumor models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology,
uh,tumor models available so uh we cannot really bridge between uh what we see in the toxicology studies and then what,tumor models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies so it will be,
uh,in our in our clinical program okay great maybe what uh thinking of one last one last question here is that,define in our clinical program okay great maybe i ll stick in one last question here is that in terms,
uh,thinking of one last one last question here is that uh in terms of adaptive uh nk cell uh from core,maybe i ll stick in one last question here is that in terms of adaptive in case cell from the,
uh,last question here is that uh in terms of adaptive uh nk cell uh from core blood derived nk cells uh,last question here is that in terms of adaptive in case cell from the cobalt deriving in case cells first,
uh,is that uh in terms of adaptive uh nk cell uh from core blood derived nk cells uh is first of,is that in terms of adaptive in case cell from the cobalt deriving in case cells first starting that pathology,
uh,uh nk cell uh from core blood derived nk cells uh is first of all could that be potentially used in,develop certain development options in combination with nk cells could be cord blood derived nk cells could be nk cells,
uh,all could that be potentially used in solid tumor and uh any comments uh comments in terms of uh regarding that,maybe in terms of could it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don t,
uh,be potentially used in solid tumor and uh any comments uh comments in terms of uh regarding that uh inaudible possibility,it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don t provide complete details on the,
uh,tumor and uh any comments uh comments in terms of uh regarding that uh inaudible possibility uh this is as adi,adaptive in case cell from the cobalt deriving in case cells first starting that pathology and this is as adi,
uh,any comments uh comments in terms of uh regarding that uh inaudible possibility uh this is as adi said something that,from the cobalt deriving in case cells first starting that pathology and this is as adi said something that we,
uh,comments in terms of uh regarding that uh inaudible possibility uh this is as adi said something that we are actively,cobalt deriving in case cells first starting that pathology and this is as adi said something that we are actively,
uh,are actively looking into um we ll starting out with uh lymphomas obviously with afm13 targeting cd30 but our vision is,is as adi said something that we are actively looking into we re starting also for afm 24 we will,
uh,lymphomas obviously with afm13 targeting cd30 but our vision is uh that also for amf24 we will develop uh certain development,said something that we are actively looking into we re starting also for afm 24 we will develop certain development,
uh,vision is uh that also for amf24 we will develop uh certain development options in combination with nk cells uh could,we re starting also for afm 24 we will develop certain development options in combination with nk cells could be,
uh,develop uh certain development options in combination with nk cells uh could be core blood derived nk cells could be nk,develop certain development options in combination with nk cells could be cord blood derived nk cells could be nk cells,
uh,derived nk cells could be nk cells from another source uh that is something that we will define but the intention,derived nk cells could be nk cells from another source that is something that we will define but the intention,
uh,have a program where afm24 would be part that was uh exogenous nk cells okay great thanks i appreciate it and,have a program where afm 24 would be partnered with exogenous nk cells okay great thanks appreciate it for another,
uh,thanks i appreciate it and congrats for all the progress uh this far there are no further questions at this time,thanks appreciate it for another problem this fall yep but for the question of this time for any closing remarks,

uh,markets that rwe operates in and the second question is uh on the renewables target growth when can we expect rwe,other markets than rwb operates in and the second question is on the renewables target growth can we expect rwe,
uh,i mean um yes the negative price rule applies to uh the uk um and we have a similar one but,your question i mean yes the negative price rule applies to the uk and we have a similar one but,
uh,on a quarterly hour basis for the full year and uh i mean it has not had a a significant negative,forecast on a quarterly hour basis for the full year and i mean it has not had a significant negative,
uh,for us even this year so for us it s uh it s a minor techna technicality um on and if,for us even this year so when we deem it appropriate that we need to update the market about new,
uh,i mean i i i just to remark i mean uh the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean um,i mean i just remarked i mean the the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean but the team,
uh,jp morgan please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon uh quick one um could you provide us a bit more,jt morgan please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon quick one could you provide us a bit more colour,
uh,we see the geographies so mainly it seems to be uh uh a footprint in uh in the french uh onshore,pipeline but at an asset level we see the geographies so mainly it s the print in the french onshore,
uh,see the geographies so mainly it seems to be uh uh a footprint in uh in the french uh onshore uh,see the geographies so mainly it s the print in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind,
uh,mainly it seems to be uh uh a footprint in uh in the french uh onshore uh market um so we,an asset level we see the geographies so mainly it s the print in the french onshore market so we,
uh,be uh uh a footprint in uh in the french uh onshore uh market um so we understand the strategy behind,see the geographies so mainly it s the print in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind,
uh,uh a footprint in uh in the french uh onshore uh market um so we understand the strategy behind it it,the print in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind it would be great if we could,
uh,a bit more color on the on the project level uh while the big projects which are in there um and,a bit more color on the project level a lot of big projects which are in there and basically what,
uh,while the big projects which are in there um and uh basically what is the expected time for contribution there uh,a lot of big projects which are in there and basically what is the expected time for contribution there one,
uh,uh basically what is the expected time for contribution there uh so that would be the question one and bouncing back,big projects which are in there and basically what is the expected time for contribution there one and bouncing back,
uh,um what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets uh given current prices buying a pipeline is one thing buying,what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets given current prices buying a pipeline is one thing buying an,
uh,is one thing buying existing operating assets is another one uh do you see that like value accretive and uh would,is one thing buying an existing operating asset is another one do you see that like value are creative and,
uh,one uh do you see that like value accretive and uh would you um in such a situation consider uh potentially,is another one do you see that like value are creative and would you in such a situation consider potentially,
uh,and uh would you um in such a situation consider uh potentially even sounding uh large acquisitions uh um by uh,and would you in such a situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions by reconsidering yours thank you neil thank,
uh,um in such a situation consider uh potentially even sounding uh large acquisitions uh um by uh reconsidering your inaudible thank,value are creative and would you in such a situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions by reconsidering yours thank,
uh,a situation consider uh potentially even sounding uh large acquisitions uh um by uh reconsidering your inaudible thank you very much,in such a situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions by reconsidering yours thank you neil thank you very much,
uh,uh potentially even sounding uh large acquisitions uh um by uh reconsidering your inaudible thank you very much yeah um thanks,a situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions by reconsidering yours thank you neil thank you very much yeah thanks,
uh,us i mean having a um a a deep pipeline uh where we can invest our money it would not be,let me start with the latter one a deep pipeline where we can invest our money it would not be,
uh,asset by asset is not part of our um investment uh investment plan i mean on the nordex pipeline i mean,assets asset by asset is not part of our investment investment plan i mean on the nordics pipeline i mean,
uh,i mean we have very good locations good wind conditions uh clusters in in geographic proximity that that um they provide,pipeline in detail as you can imagine in the due diligence and in geographic proximity that will provide efficiencies and,
uh,in a minute but i cannot talk about specific sites uh um i mean we can we can give you more,in geographic proximity that will provide efficiencies and i mean i will not talk about specific locations now now because,
uh,irs of the projects with us in our given range uh the capital market day we set for mature onshore pv,irrs of the project be within our given range at the capital market day we set for mature onshore pv,
uh,s always very difficult to judge or assess the price uh from the outside in but we have also seen other,always very difficult to judge or assess the price from the outside in but we have also seen other pipelines,
uh,my question so just a another one on the nordex uh portfolio could you sort of tell us how the 400,your question is it better our money or there and how do you structure the contract the question is who,
uh,tell us how the 400 million acquisition price and the uh i guess additional capex that you re gonna be spending,that the asset swap with eon is finally fully closed the legal integration and the hr integration have already been,
uh,where have you found the extra balance sheet capacity please uh and then my second question as she was just on,the line of peter bestiga from bofa securities capacity please and then my second question as she was just on,
uh,she was just on carbon um which has obviously been uh very volatile uh over the last um couple of quarters,second question as she was just on carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the last couple of quarters,
uh,on carbon um which has obviously been uh very volatile uh over the last um couple of quarters i guess your,she was just on carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the last couple of quarters i guess your,
uh,nordex pipeline yes it will come on top of the uh 5 billion as we have said with the announcement of,our pipeline especially as we have done with the nordics i ll come to that in a minute but acquiring,
uh,s really come down without impacting the capex then later uh the project investments after the i mean when we when,it will come down without impacting the capex then later the project investments after the i mean when we do,
uh,i mean 100 megawatts here and there that will not uh move the needle on the company of our size and,that s pure speculation i would say it will not make a huge difference and on germany of course we,
uh,how i see the market short term is more bearish uh because um i mean with the covid situation with uh,power price on the market yes we will come back thank you very much but i mean i just remarked,
uh,uh because um i mean with the covid situation with uh very low gas prices significant fuel switching uh muted industrial,ptcs given the covid situation so i mean that s pure speculation i would say it will not make a,
uh,situation with uh very low gas prices significant fuel switching uh muted industrial demand i mean the demand for comm certificates,come back thank you very much but i mean i just remarked i mean the the moment it becomes viable,
uh,even 60 reduction by 2030 a significant part of that uh maybe even um more than half needs to come from,i think that s a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the eu,
uh,view and use the liquidity they still have to buy uh cheaper than they expect the prices to be i think,let s see whether we still have time perfect thank you because i think that s the more interesting one,
uh,prices to be i think these are the two camps uh short term long term um and since this market is,have seen that a lot of industrials who are sitting on excess certificates long term and since this market is,
uh,goldman sachs please go ahead thank you and good afternoon uh the first one is to go back to the e,goldman sachs please go ahead thank you and good afternoon the first story is to go back to the eon,
uh,are seeing all companies very quickly moving into the space uh you know vp with a 50 gigawatts next target by,seeing oil companies very quickly moving base you know vp with a 50 gigawatts net target by 2030 company like,
uh,employ that amount of money until let s say 2030 uh because they are simply not enough project as you have,say that we failed on france because we were simply not present and the nordx team was actually very successful,
uh,renewables and also power overall is i mean tremendous globally uh the trend to electrification and to green is very supporting,renewables and also power overall is i mean tremendous globally the trend to electrification and to green is very supporting,
uh,or is that not this year s business thank you uh let me start with the easier one rob um i,underway or is that not this year s business thank you let me start with the easier one rob i,
uh,2 gigawatts and um we are optimistic that we can uh finalize it and by then uh book it as um,extensions and it will be around 800 megawatt to 1 2 gigawatt finalize it and by then book it as,

uh,for taking our call crosstalk good morning jenine good morning uh maybe sorry just one more on alaska if i could,afternoon everyone thanks for taking our call good morning jeanine good morning maybe sorry just one more on alaska if,
uh,know that you need resolution on ballot measure 1 first uh but is that 25 sell down still the case now,know that you need resolution on ballot measure one first but is that 25 sell down still the case now,
uh,any decisions em yeah jenine this is matt matt again uh we didn t we didn t really say it was,potentially overturn any decision i m yeah janine this is matt matt s again we didn t really say it,
uh,timing of that down until we get some of these uh uncertainties resolved so it s still on the cards that,timing of that down until we get some of these uncertainties resolved so it s still on the cards that,
uh,it s still on the cards that we ll make uh an adjustment to equity um uh in the uh in,it s still on the cards that will make an adjustment to equity alaska but we may still continue to,
uh,that we ll make uh an adjustment to equity um uh in the uh in alaska um but but we may,uncertainties resolved so it s still on the cards that will make an adjustment to equity alaska but we may,
uh,make uh an adjustment to equity um uh in the uh in alaska um but but we may still continue to,it s still on the cards that will make an adjustment to equity alaska but we may still continue to,
uh,continue to proceed with the project in the mean time uh so so so so the the timing of the project,alaska but we may still continue to proceed with the project in the meantime so the timing of the project,
uh,is what i m i m saying on the um uh ballot measure 1 and can the could the legislature overrule,the sell down i guess is what i m seeing on the ballot measure one and can the legislature overrule,
uh,inaudible for that they would have to come up with uh an alternative that was that was uh that was substantially,take a little bit of time for that we d have to come up with a an alternative that was,

uh,we is we think about the the forward curve or uh in thinking about our plans for 202 and again i,as we think about the forward curve we re thinking about our plans for 2020 and again i mentioned those,
uh,of cash flow are we projecting to to make and uh you know we we have the we have the benefit,supply but it s also what kind of cash flow are we projecting to make and we have the benefit,
uh,but y certainly we d be also trying to balance uh the the cash we re making with the capex that,we need to but certainly we d be also trying to balance the cash for making with the capex that,

uh,you know for inaudible capex it will be very similar uh on the year over year basis what would the inaudible,long camp so it would be very similar on a year over year basis what would the conic of stentable,
uh,inaudible look like relative to the the fourth quarter inaudible uh under that scenario uh yeah josh the the the we,look like relative to the fourth quarter 20 volumes under that scenario hurry up yeah josh we d expect it,

uh,we need about 3 8 for for for for conocophillips uh to stand alone and that would sustain production a a,we d need about 3 8 for conocophillips standalone and that would sustain production at one point roughly a bit,
uh,roughly you know just below 1 2 millions inaudible the uh um but but the low cost of supply that we,a bit below 1 2 million pounds would be but with the low cost of supply that we have in,
uh,and and start 2020 with that sort of tactical um uh sustaining program and then see how demand recovery and supply,in the start 2020 with that sort of tactical and sustained program and then see how demand recovery and supply,
uh,keep um production flat but we will completely shut down uh projects like willow our exploration activity uh those those things,keep production flat but we wouldn t completely shut down projects like willow or exploration activity but those things will,

uh,be cautious about that we have look at how the uh the russian and opec can respond i mean they they,to just be cautious about that we have to look at how the prussia and opec respond they have a,
uh,have a inaudible coming up in the end of november uh and see i may go back to sort of drawing,have a move coming up at the end of november and see when we get back to sort of drawing,

uh,is open oh thanks good morning everybody um i wonder uh bill maybe i could start off with you and as,is open well thanks good morning everybody i wonder bill maybe i could start off with you and ask you,
uh,any way about that any scenarios that you ve run uh outcomes that you may expect yeah sure um we ve,thought anywhere about that in any scenarios that you ve run outcomes that you may expect yeah sure we ve,

uh,the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that uh that you laid out at the strategy day um we,together the tidal wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that you laid out at the strategy day so we,
uh,comments and matt can jump in as as well but uh yeah we we spent a lot of time trying to,comments matt can jump in as well but yeah we spent a lot of time trying to think about what,
uh,like and probably a couple of competing factors we certainly uh see demand recovery we are uncertain whether it gets fully,looks like and and probably a couple of competing factors we certainly see demand recovery uncertain whether it gets fully,
uh,gets fully back to 100 million barrels a day but uh probably taking a a bit of uh bit of time,whether it gets fully back to 100 million barrels a day but probably taking a bit of a bit of,
uh,a day but uh probably taking a a bit of uh bit of time to to get there and then uh,a day but probably taking a bit of a bit of time to get there and then i think equally,
uh,uh bit of time to to get there and then uh i think equally important and maybe overlooked a little bit,of a bit of time to get there and then i think equally important and maybe overlooked a little bit,
uh,well so i can matt can probably chime in and uh describe a little bit about the net effect to uh,well so i can matt can probably chime in and describe a little bit about the and that effect to,

uh,we setting up for the bottom of a cycle here uh w w w it certainly feels that way because and,are we setting up for the bottom of a cycle here but the semi fuel s that way to us,
uh,exactly when it turns will be dependent upon the um uh uh demand and and the covid and how what opec,exactly when it turns be dependent upon the demand and the covid and what opec do in the short term,

uh,tight tighter supply demand balance in a year or so uh if not before that yeah so so short medium term,a tighter supply demand balance in a year or so isn t that before now yeah so short medium term,
uh,medium term all about demand medium longer term you know uh supply starts to enter the picture as matt described and,medium term all about demand medium longer term you know supply starts to enter the picture is matt described and,

uh,i i apologize um you d probably have to ask uh vineyard wind on about that okay but but but that,yes okay yeah i m not yeah i apologize you probably have to ask vinny dwayne about that okay that,
uh,well certainly um all of the developers off the coast uh they we ve been going through this inaudible of impact,was well certainly all of the developers off the coast you know that we ve been going through this cumulative,
uh,one nautical mile a one nautical mile spacing so certainly uh there could be components that come out in in any,one nautical mile by one nautical mile spacing so certainly there could be components that come out in any decision,
uh,a look at to see if they have any impact uh you know to other developers including us but um in,a look at see if it has any impacts you know you know to all the developers including us but,
uh,be in that or the exact timing um i think uh vineyard might might have a better perspective of that okay,might be in that or the exact timing i think vinyad might have a better perspective of that okay perfect,

uh,as you recall we uh that pura suspending the rates uh that we had implemented over the summer both we and,so that s all the pure suspenders the rates that we had implemented over the summer both we and ui,
uh,that we had implemented over the summer both we and uh inaudible to take an additional look think this is what,rates that we had implemented over the summer both we and ui to take an additional look i think this,
uh,to flush out any anything but it s consistent with uh on first blush i d say it s consistent with,flush out anything but it s consistent with on first blush i d say it s consistent with the purest,
uh,it s consistent with um pura s desire to have uh some rate changes you know move instead of implementing rates,it s consistent with the purest desire to have some rate changes you know instead of implementing rates at peak,
uh,you know change the time of it to implement it uh maybe in a in a shoulder month like as like,you know change the time of it to implement it maybe you know in a shoulder a month like may,
uh,something um and move to annual reconciliations as opposed to uh semi annual so this this would um you know it,month like may or something and move to annual reconciliation as opposed to semi annual so this would you know,
uh,you know it does it does delays this could have uh effectively this is a cash flow uh item and it,would you know if there s delay it just could have effectively this is a cash flow item and it,

uh,uh no inaudible that is a point too um the uh um the carrying costs at at prime which is consistent,you did that is a point too the carrying cost at prime which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions,
uh,know item but um it it s certainly one that uh pura had put out there in the draft just to,significant you know item but it s certainly one that pure had put out there in the draft is to,
uh,pura had put out there in the draft just to uh recover the deferred balances with uh with a prime prime,certainly one that pure had put out there in the draft is to recover the deferred balances with a prime,
uh,the draft just to uh recover the deferred balances with uh with a prime prime rate um versus a a wack,that pure had put out there in the draft is to recover the deferred balances with a prime rate versus,

uh,adoption great and the second question i know um with uh with the recent introduction of the apexmems family you re,required by our customers in the recent introduction of our apex men s family of resonator products psytime now offers,
uh,um in those resonator structures thank you yeah yeah absolutely uh we to answer the second question first we do need,frequency changes in those resonator structures yeah yeah absolutely we don t answer the second question first we do need,
uh,we to answer the second question first we do need uh a new mask set um but um sometimes uh those,yeah absolutely we don t answer the second question first we do need a new mask set but sometimes those,

uh,seasonality going forward first half first second half first q uh versus maybe before um you know coming into this year,seasonality going forward first half first second half first queue versus maybe before coming into this here sure well if,
uh,coming into this year sure well if you look at uh the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality,coming into this here sure well if you look at the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality,
uh,that we saw pretty much the same thing this year uh you know the back half of this year much stronger,that we saw pretty much the same thing this year you know the back half of this year much stronger,
uh,i think next year it s gonna be somewhat similar uh in terms of first half versus second half obviously we,think next year it s gonna be somewhat similar in terms of first half versus second half obviously we expect,

uh,good growth we re not quantifying that at this point uh but in terms of the seasonality it s gonna look,good growth we re not quantifying that at this point but in terms of the seasonality it s going to,
uh,and then perhaps on the um the infrastructure side 5g uh wireless infrastructure in particular um are you having design wins,s very helpful and then perhaps on the infrastructure side 5g wireless infrastructure in particular are you having design wins,
uh,might you ebb and flow with the 5g build out uh puts and takes yeah i think it s a slow,might you ebb and flow with the 5g build out puts and takes yeah i think it s a slow,

uh,this is probably a five seven year um rollout and uh should be a very very solid place for sitime helpful,this is probably a five seven year rollout and should be a very very solid place for site time okay,
uh,question from inaudible from william blair your line s open uh sure maybe a quick question for art um just on,your next question from alessandro vecci from william blair lines open sure maybe a quick question for art just on,
uh,of quarters with very little um opex flow through yeah uh so i m wondering uh how to think about it,revenue the last couple of quarters with very little op ex flow through so wondering how to think about it,
uh,um opex flow through yeah uh so i m wondering uh how to think about it yeah great great great question,with very little op ex flow through so wondering how to think about it you had great great great question,
uh,t ramp expenses quite fast enough my guide for q4 uh we re guiding revenue up 10 to 15 and i,couldn t ramp expenses quite fast enough my guide for q4 we re guiding revenue up 10 to 15 and,
uh,eight to 10 so that s a little more than uh half the top line rate but that s because of,8 to 10 so that s a little more than half the top line rate but that s because of,
uh,up because we were s so low in terms of uh opex growth in q2 so does that does that kind,up because we were so low in terms of opec s growth in q2 so does that kind of frame,
uh,does that does that kind of frame it for you uh yeah that helps um and then and i i i,of opec s growth in q2 so does that kind of frame it for you yeah yeah that helps i,

uh,we always would like to retain the ability to invest uh at a at a greater rate you know within reason,we always would like to retain the ability to invest at a greater rate you within reason to the model,
uh,yeah i would say that s even slower inaudible okay uh i would say that uh you know be because uh,for the customer standpoint yeah i would say that s even slower alex i would say that you know because,
uh,s even slower inaudible okay uh i would say that uh you know be because uh there s two kinds of,s even slower alex i would say that you know because there s two kinds of design winds we would,
uh,uh i would say that uh you know be because uh there s two kinds of design wins we would have,even slower alex i would say that you know because there s two kinds of design winds we would have,
uh,would have standalone design wins so we would go to uh oems and sell them resonators that s one uh and,would have stand alone design wins so we would go to oems and sell them resonators that s one and,
uh,to uh oems and sell them resonators that s one uh and then the other one would be to go to,go to oems and sell them resonators that s one and then the other one would be to go to,
uh,for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the uh clocking business um so um yeah so of course there,for that for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the clocking business so yeah so of course there,
uh,be other times when it can happen very fast but uh but generally that s a good rule of thumb um,there can be other times when it can happen very fast but generally that s a good rule of thumb,
uh,s a good rule of thumb um that s helpful uh that s it for me thank you thanks alex we,a good rule of thumb that s helpful that s it for me thank you thanks alex we have your,
uh,um i guess the question on on margins and um uh i i i guess as we go forward into next,yes thank you good evening i guess question on on margins and i guess as we go forward into next,
uh,year there s a lot of different factors with um uh seasonality uh some of the different margin profiles or the,into next year there s a lot of different factors with seasonality some of the different margin profiles of the,
uh,s a lot of different factors with um uh seasonality uh some of the different margin profiles or the different segments,there s a lot of different factors with seasonality some of the different margin profiles of the the different segments,
uh,the first half of next year as some of the uh consumer related products uh you know typically would be seemingly,year particularly in the first half of next year as some of the consumer related products typically would be seemingly,
uh,next year as some of the uh consumer related products uh you know typically would be seemingly weaker yeah great great,next year as some of the consumer related products typically would be seemingly weaker yeah great question you know our,
uh,year generally our mobile iot and consumer business which is uh somewhat lower gross margin not that much lower but a,year year generally our mobile iot and consumer business which is somewhat lower gross margins not that much lower but,
uh,the the poor mix is offset by the higher at uh uh manufacturing efficiencies in the second half of the year,as the poorer mix is offset by the higher ed manufacturing efficiencies in in the second half of the year,
uh,the poor mix is offset by the higher at uh uh manufacturing efficiencies in the second half of the year right,the poorer mix is offset by the higher ed manufacturing efficiencies in in the second half of the year right,
uh,second half of the year right and and the volume uh is is a little heavier weighting so uh i would,second half of the year right and the volume is a little heavier weighty so i would actually expect gross,
uh,the volume uh is is a little heavier weighting so uh i would actually expect gross margins to to pull back,year right and the volume is a little heavier weighty so i would actually expect gross margins to pull back,
uh,be much stronger in the back half of next year uh even stronger of course than they are in the back,be much stronger in the back half of next year stronger of course than they are in the back half,
uh,helpful thank you um a as a follow up um uh perhaps you could talk to us about you know kinda,very helpful thank you as a follow up uh perhaps you could talk to us about you know kind of,
uh,s a lot of opportunities in in front of you uh you know wha in in in terms of what do,re targeting for next year there s a lot of opportunities in front of you in terms of what do,

uh,connection growing in the middle aerospace market and then finally uh the mobile iot piece inaudible the consumer the mobile iot,connection growing in the middle aerospace market and then finally the mobile iot piece of it less the consumer the,
uh,of it is always a natural place for sitimes growth uh because you know the size the resiliency the performance so,of it is always a natural place for site times growth because you know the size the resiliency their performance,
uh,the size the resiliency the performance so i i think uh we re also um continuing to expand our customer base,you know the size the resiliency their performance so i think we re also continuing to expand our customer base,
uh,our customer base you know five years ago we were uh addressing about 2 000 customers today we re about five,continuing to expand our customer base five years ago we were addressing about 2 000 customers today we re about,
uh,about five x that maybe a little bit more and uh so i think the expansion of customer base this is,about five x stats maybe a little bit more and so i think the expansion of customer base this is,

uh,on the top and that s what can they can uh dislodge from each other and so you know we put,on the top and that s what can happen they can dislodge from each other so you know we put,
uh,other and so you know we put incredible importance on uh consumer safety and when we saw this reported we had,so you know we put incredible importance on consumer safety and when we saw this report of it we had,
uh,we had an opportunity to quickly quickly wrap it and uh and get it off the market and put our team,had an opportunity to quickly wrap it and get it off the market and put our team back to work,
uh,the product out in the market that we thought was uh deserving of the yeti brand and then peter on the,product out in the market we thought was deserving of the eddie brand and then peter on the sales impact,
uh,does that impact current products so when we pulled the uh travel mug you know the perceived cannibalization of other products,does that impact current products so when we pulled the travel mug you know the perceived cannibalization of other products,
uh,proceed with your question thank you good morning guys and uh great job on the quarter um i wanted to drill,please proceed with your question thank you good morning guys and great job on the quarter i wanted to drill,
uh,making i think you had some inventory constraints also um uh during the middle of the quarter and obviously inaudible in,making but i think you have some inventory constraints also um uh during the middle of the quarter um and,
uh,understand what categories you are feeling particularly light on and uh how you are thinking about um you know is there,understand what categories you re feeling particularly light on and how how you re thinking about you know are a,
uh,the other so are you going to feed your dtc uh first when supply comes back or is coming through and,the other so are you going to feed your dtc first when supply comes back or it is coming through,
uh,um and where we could see some alleviation of that uh of that inventory flow sure so let me start with,exist and where we could see some alleviation of that of that inventory flow sure so let me start with,
uh,have expected to to drive 29 top line growth in uh the third quarter so it is really we have all,would have expected to drive 29 top line growth in the third quarter so it is really we have all,
uh,into the into the u s on the west coast uh and then certainly just logistics in in getting the um,into into the u s and the west coast and then certainly just logistics in getting the goods to our,
uh,and then just on the categories is there a specific uh under inventoried position that s more um that s more,and then just on the categories is there a specific under inventory position that s more or that s more,
uh,talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a uh a coronavirus mitigation um so i was i benefited from,which again as we talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a coronavirus mitigation so i benefited from,
uh,you re clearly benefiting from um are you are you uh at all seeing anything on the competitive landscape where um,you re clearly benefiting from are you at all seeing anything on the competitive landscape where a customer is leaving,
uh,and how are you trying to mitigate you know that uh potential lost sale or that lost customer that um you,and how are you trying to mitigate you know that potential loss sale or that loss customer that may be,
uh,we don t tend to see a lot of leakage uh of the of the customer and part is because we,we don t tend to see a lot of leakage of the customer and part of it is because we,
uh,something to come back and stock or we present alternative uh alternative products that i think is our one of the,something to come back and stock or we present alternative products that i think is one of the benefits of,
uh,e commerce team is that we re able to identify uh more smartly where consumers are and and where they are,commerce team is that we re able to identify more smartly where consumers are and where they are in the,

um,is a a very low cost opportunity that we see um out on a near sourcing uh potential so we re,haiti and asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from,
um,so far and we re just expanding the building so um it s not a significant expense you know we re,so can we maybe expand a little bit on those strategies and then secondly is there you know a bigger,
um,we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today um and co if it s shown in haiti and comes,is we can bring fabric anywhere in the world today and if it s shown in haiti and comes back,
um,ability to bring some of that back to the us um not preferred on lead time basis but it could be,in the u s or bring fabric and covers of our own back to us in the u s we,
um,lead time basis but it could be good for costs um and we ll just do that on an as needed,in a small way be good for cost and we ll just do that on an as needed basis and,

um,re you re moving as quickly as you possibly can um almost anywhere that you can so if you look at,this you re moving as quickly as you possibly can almost anywhere that you can so if you look at,
um,20 and 21 almost all of that in in capital um and i would also say that we expect to have,maturity for 2021 almost all of that in capital and i would also say you know we expect to have,
um,me this time yes yes clearly josh good morning awesome um and and hope everyone is is well to echo earlier,hear me this time yes clearly josh good morning awesome awesome and hope everyone is as well that got earlier,
um,anything uh kind of on par with uh with this um but there s there s no question that there s,years past sure we ve seen anything kind of on par with this but there s no question that there,
um,reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft um and that will factor into the uh to the aftermarket,to play out as we go through the course of the year we can t really scope that for you,
um,combination of these factors is gonna create pressure for us um a force here in the short term uh i think,combination of these factors it s going to create pressure for us for us here in the short term i,
um,hey guys good morning hey steve good morning good morning um in in uh in early march you guys had that,morgan we have steve tusa thanks josh hey guys good morning hey steve good morning i ve had that slide,
um,in early march you guys had that slide that showed um you know 2 to 4 billion in you know free,i ve had that slide that showed uh you know two to four billion in you know free cash flow,
um,billion base i think you know most uh research and um numbers i saw were kind of in that you know,base i think you know most uh research and uh numbers i saw were kind of in that you know,
um,numbers i saw were kind of in that you know um 6 billion range of of free cash flows to kind,numbers i saw were kind of in that you know six billion dollar range of free cash flows to kind,
um,of growth off of that level are are we still um like is is are the iata numbers um still at,of growth off of that level are we still like are the out year numbers withdrawing that long term outlook,
um,we still um like is is are the iata numbers um still at all legit or is that you know are,we still like are the out year numbers withdrawing that long term outlook as well steve i think we have,
um,in the face of this uh this unprecedented dyna pandemic um we ve taken guidance off for the year we re,the face of this unprecedented pandemic we ve taken guidance off for the year we re not putting it back,
um,re trying to get out any further than than that um i appreciate the question but i think for purposes of,re trying to get out any further than that i appreciate the question but i think for purposes of today,
um,for purposes of today we re really just trying to um frame for folks what what we re seeing but that,purposes of today we re really just trying to frame for folks what we re seeing but that said however,
um,think that on the on the recovery we would see um we would see it swing the other way when we,highest margin of business is really feeling it here we would see it swing the other way so when we,
um,the across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare yeah um y your your second question steve is relative to the,mix of fact really across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare your second question steve is relative to the,
um,significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter um i mean uh most companies kind of one for one,pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter i mean most companies kind of won for one,
um,cash basis yeah i i think what we have said um previously we were gonna be down off of last year,i think much of what we re seeing in aviation broadly it will be pushed out for a few years,
um,to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs um but all the while if we can uh we can,to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs but all the while if we can make more structural,
um,year on year but as carolina indicated in her remarks um we wanna try to do more if we can great,be relatively flat year on year but just we want to try to do more if we can great all,
um,go ahead all right good morning larry carolina and steve um let me maybe follow up on the uh on the,go ahead good morning larry caroline and steve let me maybe follow up on the application marcus good morning hey,
um,up on the uh on the aviation marcus good morning um hey good morning um within the year so in your,up on the application marcus good morning hey good morning within the year reference the yata numbers of 48 rpk,
um,on the aviation marcus good morning um hey good morning um within the year so in your q 10 q you,on the application marcus good morning hey good morning within the year reference the yata numbers of 48 rpk reduction,
um,bodies coming back first because they re probably the youngest um the youngest in the fleet right right and so i,engines that are on the narrowbodies coming back first because they re probably the youngest in the fleet right to,
um,the april experience and the near term projection of that um there s no question that we re gonna continue to,to the april experience and the near that we re going to continue to see the pressure on cash and,
um,here of late right and that that will be our um undoubtedly our our biggest headwind no sure sure sure but,here of late right and that will be undoubtedly our biggest headwind no sure but you know internal stress test,
um,you said but did you do sort of internal internal um stress test around um w where you could end up,will be undoubtedly our biggest headwind no sure but you know internal stress test around where you could end up,
um,you do sort of internal internal um stress test around um w where you could end up or is that is,biggest headwind no sure but you know internal stress test around where you could end up or if that is,
um,followup quickly on on the capital side do you anticipate um any change in the in the capital support there for,follow up quickly on the capital side do you anticipate any change in the capital support there for insurance in,
um,at the moment on the current support uh to capital um yeah on the insurance yeah let s yeah let s,thinking about that at the moment on the parent support to capital and on the insurance let s take a,
um,this year is two billion uh on the insurance funding um and those two billion um you know they re significantly,this year is two billion on insurance funding need to support rough in mind with this some variables are still,
um,uh on the insurance funding um and those two billion um you know they re significantly lower than the year uh,the 2 billion of cost the 3 billion of cash will clearly help us later on in the year is,
um,know they re significantly lower than the year uh before um we estimated that the inaudible will need to support roughly,any other indicator and those cycles are before the passengers do as you indicated the age of the fleet will,
um,basically it s about two billion as it looks now um and i would also say going forward inaudible followup uh,basically it s about 2 billion as it looks now and i would also to say going forward which is,
um,followup uh we do continue to to anticipate further funding um and that will be again through a combination of ge,political follow up we do continue to anticipate further funding and that will be again through a combination of g,
um,itself through their asset inaudible liquidity and their future earnings um and on top of that possible capital contributions from ge,their asset sales liquidity and their future earnings and on top of that possible capital contributions thank you from coen,
um,sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up um the spares business the aftermarket the 15 billion commercial aftermarket,sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up the spares business the aftermarket the 15 billion commercial aftermarket,
um,we we we are a cycles business much more so um than than any other indicator and those cycles are gonna,premise per se right we are a cycles business much more so than any other indicator and those cycles are,
um,uh we ll we ll see how that plays out um i think i think what we re acknowledging here is,and i m just one other point i think worth mentioning and i think what we re acknowledging here is,
um,like in aviation we re gonna have a strong recovery um any so so as we emerge from this we re,are and just to follow up obviously 2020 is a tough year so as we emerge from this we re,
um,de leverage what else besides cost reduction can you do um to get the balance sheet better uh faster is there,sales to deleverage what else besides cost reduction can you do to get the balance sheet better faster is there,
um,and uh capital i think it s up to 10 um on on a year to date business given given some,the cycle i think it s too early to tell we ve got to get on the improvement path first,
um,and uh i think it s important to say that um you really want to maintain a high level of trust,and i think it s important to say that you really want to maintain a high level of cash to,
um,have inaudible the de risking activities that we have made um to sort of push out the debt and uh for,maximise the flexibility and you have seen the de wisking activities that we have made thank you yeah and i,
um,we we ended the quarter with 47 billion of liquidity um on the back of the bio pharma action and some,to remember we ended the quarter but 47 billion of liquidity on the back of the biopharma action and some,
um,we have julian mitchell please go ahead hi good morning um maybe uh just a question around good morning julian good,we have julian mitchell please go ahead hi good morning maybe just a question around where are you julian good,
um,good morning uh maybe just a first question around the um the working capital uh dynamics and the free cashflow at,you julian good morning maybe just the first question around the working capital dynamics in the free cash flow at,
um,working capital uh dynamics and the free cashflow at aviation um i guess yeah there s a lot of industrial businesses,capital dynamics in the free cash flow at aviation i guess you know there s a lot of industrial businesses,
um,sort of in the early stages now in this downturn um what you would expect to happen to working capital when,sort of in the early stages now in this downturn what you would expect to to happen to work in,
um,we were gonna have to adjust to a different schedule um with the max chasing the uh the step up at,we were going to have to adjust to a different schedule with of past due on the commercial side both,
um,past due on the commercial side both both oe and um aftermarket while having pretty good military demand to uh to,past due on the commercial side both oe and aftermarket while having pretty good military demand to contend with all,
um,in light of current current demand but should we expect um so i guess i i understand crosstalk yeah is there,in light of current demand but should we expect so i guess i understand i m sorry you re in,
um,how much of a uh a tailwind could it be um kind of at this point in the cycle um i,you re alluding to much of a tailwind could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i,
um,be um kind of at this point in the cycle um i think it s too early to tell we we,could it be kind of at this point in the cycle i think it s too early to tell we,
um,you and then my second question was just around the um the operational issues so i think it sounds like the,take that potential and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you operational issues in power on the,
um,like the cost out tailwind should build through the year um but in q1 you had some operational issues in in,take that potential and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you operational issues in power on the,
um,think you have to take it business by business right um if if you look at what happened in power uh,think you have to take it business by business right if you look at what happened in power clearly the,
um,re dealing with different uh dynamics in the respective businesses um and that s really why i think i have the,re dealing with different dynamics in the respective businesses and that s really why i think i have the confidence,
um,and uh carolina great to uh see you on board um so look we appreciate all the color and and slides,morning everyone and karina great to see you on board so look we appreciate all the colour in the slides,
um,you bet additional color in in the in the queue um so is is larry is it now a base case,the colour in the slides and the additional colour in the queue i think what we re trying to share,
um,free cash relatively steady yeah i i i think what um i think what we re trying to to share this,colour in the slides and the additional colour in the queue i think what we re trying to share this,
um,re trying to to share this morning nigel is that um probably three things one we we ve we ve been,i think what we re trying to share this morning nigel is that probably three things one we ve been,
um,we ve been hit hard and fast here right in um some of our uh most important highest margin businesses be,we ve been hit hard and fast here in some of our most important highest margin businesses be it aviation,
um,important highest margin businesses be it aviation in services particularly um gas power services uh pdx and and healthcare we think,most important highest margin businesses be it aviation and services particularly gas power services pdx in health care we think,
um,to it okay i appreciate that larry thanks and then um you know i thought one of the one of the,to it okay i appreciate that larry thanks i thought one of the real highlights of the quarter was the,
um,the the key thing to keep in mind nigel is um the the big iron certainly got hit um the the,think the key thing to keep in mind the lower ticket the lower price points be a patient monitors ventilators,
um,nigel is um the the big iron certainly got hit um the the the lower um uh the lower ticket the,out to the margins well we certainly i think the key thing to keep in mind the lower ticket the,
um,big iron certainly got hit um the the the lower um uh the lower ticket the the lower price points be,we certainly i think the key thing to keep in mind the lower ticket the lower price points be a,
um,uh so there was a little bit of mix there um but but not a lot it was really more a,the business so there was a little bit of mix there but not a lot it was really more a,
um,tend to the core cost structure in all its form um in the hcs business right we we ve been growing,tend to the core cost structure in all its form in the hcs business right we ve been growing health,
um,dean good good morning just two questions uh both aviation um lot of discussion about structural cost out and larry would,thank you good morning larry any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural,
um,of that and and perhaps carolina can take the second um i i think we are mindful uh ever mindful that,the first part of that and perhaps carolina can take the second i think we are mindful ever mindful that,
um,s gonna be very good business for ge for for um decades um but i i think we are really trying,to be a very good business for ge for four decades i think we are really trying to again embrace,
um,be very good business for ge for for um decades um but i i think we are really trying to again,going to be a very good business for ge for four decades i think we are really trying to again,
um,would say the progress refunds are very small so far um but on top of that we also saw unk right,i would say the progress we found are very small so far but on top of that we also saw,
um,the line of derek de bruin with bank of america um hi good morning all right derek hey um so a,from the line of derek de bruyne with bank of america hi good morning good morning derek hey so a,
um,of america um hi good morning all right derek hey um so a couple of questions um and then uh i,bruyne with bank of america hi good morning good morning derek hey so a couple of questions and then i,
um,all right derek hey um so a couple of questions um and then uh i ll i ll congratulate you on,america hi good morning good morning derek hey so a couple of questions and then i ll congratulate you on,

um,you re embedding into the guide in the 2q for um covid related contributions i mean you re producing a lot,you re embedding into the guide in the 2q for covid related contributions i mean you re producing a a,
um,a lot of cepheid tests you know the serologies ramping um i guess are all those tests going to be used,of sepia tests the serologies ramping i guess are all those tests going to be used into the guide thanks,
um,guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek uh happy to um walk you through that a bit so if let s,guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek i m happy to walk you through predominantly with cepheid radiometer and idt,
um,in q2 and and i would think about it as um largely a tailwind that probably represents you know 500 basis,i think the place that i d start is probably about 40 decrementals it can vary you know quite a,
um,terms of the related question about what s spoken for um you know cepheid were were flat out at at cepheid,and in terms of the related question about what s spoken for you know cepheid we re flat out at,
um,you know cepheid were were flat out at at cepheid um we are we are continuing to expand our capacity um,you know cepheid we re flat out at cepheid we are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that,
um,um we are we are continuing to expand our capacity um but every test that we produce every single day uh,flat out at cepheid we are continuing to expand our capacity but every test that we produce every single day,
um,uh gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build um radiometer also running flat out um not quite the need,gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build also running flat out not quite the need for expanded capacity,
um,is continuing to build um radiometer also running flat out um not quite the need for expanded capacity we had the,gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build also running flat out not quite the need for expanded capacity,
um,capacity we needed there but they re doing exceptionally well um and idt holding its own as well so i think,surge capacity we needed there but they re doing exceptionally well and idt holding its own as well i think,
um,think overall you d consider cepheid radiometer and idt certainly um con contributors on the positive side um what that really,think overall you d consider cepheid radiometer and idt certainly contributors on the positive side related but certainly related to,
um,and idt certainly um con contributors on the positive side um what that really means is that the rest of the,overall you d consider cepheid radiometer and idt certainly contributors on the positive side related but certainly related to the,
um,derek it s matt i just wanna make sure also um you ve kind of uh we mentioned serology we are,derek and matt it s matt hey derek it s matt kind of we mentioned serology we are not assuming,
um,really helpful and i guess just one question on cytiva um and and in general did you see any stocking in,to look for hotspots over time in terms of your question about cytiva and work around therapies and vaccines i,
um,growth in the cytiva standalone business for the second quarter um derek we saw uh you know very little it s,for the business to be here in the second quarter as well so i think your math on that is,
um,it s uh you know uh uh on the margins um as to whether or not there was there was stocking,thanks tycho you know there s we ve got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts,
um,or not there was there was stocking going on there um you know generally we don t don t think it,tool and so the the answer is we re working we re doing our best we re off to a,
um,driven by folks working on solutions to to covid 19 um and but you know as we look forward i think,really driven by folks working on solutions to covid 19 but you know as we look forward i think we,
um,the the uh the end of march 1st of april um we re just getting in there to really understand what,we just closed the end of march 1st of april we re just getting in there to really understand what,
um,you know there s there s plenty of uncertainties about um how much that volume will build over time depending on,you know there s we ve got a lot going on as it relates to the future impacts of covid,
um,i think we ve got an outstanding start here but um you know in terms of w where we are from,think we ve got an outstanding start here but you know in terms of where we are from a guide,
um,size up what that backlog is starting to look like um obviously we haven t even gotten face to face with,size up what that backlog is starting to look like obviously we haven t even gotten face to face with,
um,good deal of rebranding work that we need to do um we re gonna stand it up as a standalone operating,obviously a good deal of rebranding work that we need to do to stand it up as a standalone operating,
um,right time sure absolutely tycho i d be happy to um you know i i can honestly say that you you,right time sure absolutely tycho i d be happy to but i can honestly say that you would have to,
um,you would have to go all the way back to um my very first year uh in the role where uh,you would have to go all the way back to my very first year in the role where we along,

um,know on a multi year basis thanks sure thanks tycho um you know there s uh we ve got a lot,those businesses on a multi year basis thanks sure thanks tycho you know there s we ve got a lot,
um,as it uh as it relates to the the future um impacts of covid and i think in many respects we,as it relates to the future impacts of covid and i think in many respects we re pretty uniquely positioned,
um,positioned both on the short term and the long term um i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing,positioned both on the short term and the long term i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing,
um,think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective um cepheid s impact along with idt radiometer in terms of,i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective cepheid s impact along terms of treatment on the,
um,idt radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line um as well as beckman in in serology and ig igg,perspective cepheid s impact along terms of treatment on the front line as well as beckman and serology and igg,
um,asked about the durability of the cepheid test i think um you know as you know well we are one of,asked about the durability of the cepheid test i think you know as you know well we are one of,
um,same platform in the same cartridge inaudible same cartridge configuration um is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have,and the same cartridge job the same cartridge configuration is a real advantage and a real opportunity we we have,
um,terms of the test cartridges themselves but it s driving um a significant increase in our install base and so in,in terms of the test cartridges themselves but it s driving a significant increase in our install base and so,
um,benefit as well so we think there s exceptional durability um to uh to the the cepheid architecture in an environment,that s gonna benefit as well so we think there s exceptional durability to the cepheid architecture in an environment,
um,both therapies as well as uh as well as vaccines um in terms of your your question about beckman and serology,environment have both therapies as well as as well as vaccines in terms of your question about beckman in serology,
um,the igg tests integrated into more routine testing and therefore um the cost per test is gonna be quite reasonable um,the igg test integrated into more routine testing and therefore to be in line with other immunoassay tests and so,
um,um the cost per test is gonna be quite reasonable um and it s gonna be in line with other immunoassay,the serology test the igg test integrated into more routine testing and therefore to be in line with other immunoassay,
um,but i think it s representative of the fact that um serology testing that igg test is gonna become more of,but i think it s representative of the fact that serology testing that igg test is going to become more,
um,that igg test is gonna become more of a standard um in basic testing when it comes to uh immunoassay so,testing that igg test is going to become more of a standard in basic testing when it comes to immunoassay,

um,um i d start uh vijay with the fact that um rainer and i have worked together closely um for virtually,transition sure well i d start bj with the fact that reiner and i have worked together closely for virtually,
um,fact that um rainer and i have worked together closely um for virtually all of his his 10 years um you,fact that reiner and i have worked together closely for virtually when reiner was first hired at danahur he came,
um,closely um for virtually all of his his 10 years um you know i don t know if everybody knows that,closely for virtually when reiner was first hired at danahur he came in initially as the president of videojet and,
um,everybody knows that when rainer was first uh first hired um at at danaher um he came in initially as the,i have worked together closely for virtually when reiner was first hired at danahur he came in initially as the,

um,and i have worked together literally every day since then um through the the the work at sciex through the acquisitions,and i have worked together literally every day since then through the work at sciac through the acquisitions of paul,
um,the opportunity that has become cytiva our largest acquisition ever um and so you know when you ve worked together um,the opportunity that has become cytiva our m a and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place,
um,um and so you know when you ve worked together um for as long as we have i guess there there,and he and i have worked together literally every day since then through the work at sciac through the acquisitions,
um,there do tend to be quite a number of similarities um about the two of us but you know vijay you,lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value but you know reiner will put,
um,is super smart he is steeped in in the domains um not only in life science but but across danaher um,as this surge in demand now is happening we re seeing that and not only in terms of the test,
um,um not only in life science but but across danaher um he s unbelievably well respected across danaher as a dbs,put his own mark on danaher and i am supremely confident that that mark on danaher is going to be,
um,purpose of helping realize life s potential every single day um you know his track record relative to m and a,in advance but you know i think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a,
um,driving innovation by being willing to to to place bets um both early stage bets as well as more mature bets,bias towards driving innovation by being willing to place bets both early stage bets as well as more mature bets,
um,bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation um is uh is unparalleled so i um you know i,bets both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation is unparalleled so you know i,

um,you know question for perhaps for matt matt i think um you know the press release had a couple of hundred,just maybe one housekeeping question for perhaps from matt matt i think the press release had a couple of hundred,
um,a couple of hundred basis points that contribution from cytiva um that perhaps in place uh you know double digits maybe,a couple of hundred basis points app simpli is double digits maybe even low teens growth in that business i,
um,uh is that just uh the business uh you know um growth as usual or was there any contribution perhaps from,religious in 2q is that just the business you know growth as usual or was there any contribution perhaps from,
um,think your your math on that is is pretty correct um as far as decremental margins go i think um the,well so i think your math on that is pretty correct as far as decremental margins go i think the,
um,correct um as far as decremental margins go i think um the place that i d start is probably about 40,pretty correct as far as decremental margins go i think the place that i d start is probably about 40,
um,think starting with 40 is a good place to start um i will tell you that uh you probably in in,think starting with 40 is a good place to start you probably in q2 in diagnostics though probably need to,

um,mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning um good morning julian m morning maybe just a a first,next question comes from julian mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning morning maybe just a first,
um,a a first question on that point on decremental margins um so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing,just a first question on that point on incremental margins so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing,
um,uh cost synergies through the year and also of that um 40 to 50 million of of other costs out actions,the cost synergies through the that are more related to discretionary or volume related those are largely second quarter during,
um,know inaudible probably 80 to 90 million of end year um you know growth and downturn i would say that it,the 80 to 90 million of in year you know and i ll say that it s kind of consistent,
um,q3 and q4 then maybe just my uh second question um for you or for emily around the free cash flow,from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of q3 and q4 emily around the free cash flow,
um,a break even free cash but assume we play out um you know what kind of you know of sales are,have assumptions around a break take even free cash but assume you can play out what kind of sales are,
um,q1 what s the rough uh assumptions for the year um yes we re very pleased with with the q1 cash,separation cash cost in q1 what s the rough assumption for the year julian and we ve been managing cash,
um,you saw there julian and we ve been managing cash um you know from to put in good processes and strong,for the year julian and we ve been managing cash you know from to put in good processes and strong,
um,but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through um wi and we re really managing you know payments as,but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move position in our liquid and how about the costs i d,
um,receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions um you know what the future holds um a lot of,able to you know not only you know just a few years ago and there s just a lot of,
um,and liquidity positions um you know what the future holds um a lot of that s you know gonna depend o,new markets and that s what a lot of the team are doing is you know how do we are,
um,a lot of that s you know gonna depend o um for sure but we know we ll maintain our cash,come to the provision we also see a lot of you know tailwinds i m sorry we see tailwinds as,
um,63 million in q1 there ll be some some incremental um i don t have the i don t have the,in light of that 63 million in qe1 there will be some incremental i don t have the figure at,
um,more the uh the older kind of perspective so so um the second part of the question um liquidity is in,year two year three but more the other kind of perspective so second part of the question liquidity is in,
um,perspective so so um the second part of the question um liquidity is in a strong position um you know some,but more the other kind of perspective so second part of the question liquidity is in a strong position you,
um,of the question um liquidity is in a strong position um you know some of the the one off things is,of the question liquidity is in a strong position you guys have to be a little bit more aggressive with,
um,know some of the the one off things is operation um you know and and some of the extra things emily,we don t have a lot of historical because as you know as you can imagine a lot of these,
um,more aggressive with the with the cash outflow and then um secondarily are you inaudible to do that that we re,a little bit more aggressive with the cash out flow and then second area related to that that we re,

um,mike deck with database analysis um thank you very much um my question is on energy costs please um they were,best with database analysis thank you very much but my question is on energy costs please they were down i,
um,very much um my question is on energy costs please um they were down i think in colombia 8 8 in,very much but my question is on energy costs please they were down i think in colombia 8 8 in,
um,costs in colombia please for the rest of the year um secondly in the u s were there any savings in,as we they have been first coded of the year in the u s we have seen significant savings in,
um,savings in diesel from from our ready mix uh significant um very good very good performance because of the the lower,have seen significant savings in users or our very limited fleet significant damage very good performance because of the lower,
um,and the caribbean the all of the countries are oil um importers and pet coke so the reality is in terms,the gap of the internal crisis is a reason for party crisis has widened so the reality is that we,
um,welcome juan uh from my part this is tomas restrepo um i would just like to add the impact of this,welcome one from my part i would just like to add that the impact of these energy cost reduction on,
um,lower inaudible prices of energy to the to the local um energy that s available so they receive significant saving um,significant lower cost for lower price of iron to the local energy that s available there were significant savings or,
um,um energy that s available so they receive significant saving um we re also um installing or or putting in operation,local energy that s available there were significant savings or on negotiate prices or you re seeing prices reduced by,
um,available so they receive significant saving um we re also um installing or or putting in operation a a solid fuel,available there were significant savings or on negotiate prices or you re seeing prices reduced by 10 to 15 per,
um,of the country uh we were before we were buying um um coke from a local supplier and now we re,of the country amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price we also supplied during the first quarter of,
um,the country uh we were before we were buying um um coke from a local supplier and now we re able,the community prices depend in the future for the operation and we re also looking at implementing or looking at,
um,supplier and now we re able to bring in uh um our ships of 30 to 40 000 tons which uh,the previous months and now we ll be able to provide us some color about the volumes in the u,
um,uh panama and dominican republic we have a very competitive um construction negotiated with local energy suppliers thank you juan thank,such as panama and the middle republic we have very competitive construction the local energy suppliers thank you juan thank,
um,respect to diesel i mean we have seen some movements um at the competition in our ready mix business but again,respect to diesel we have seen some movement at the pump especially in our rate and mix business but again,
um,uh this was also variable cost and we are basically um addressing fixed costs and topics excellent thank you very much,i said it is variable cost and we are basically addressing the fixed cost and tactics thank you very much,
um,that that s necessary in a situation like this one um but jus jus just to give you a little bit,that that s necessary in a situation like this one and that just to give you a little more color,
um,decreased by 7 5 heavily impacted by an fx effect um of 5 90 versus previous year gross profit went down,see that the net turnover decreased by 7 5 heavily impacted by an ethics effect of 5 9 versus of,
um,with an ebit of chf45 million 21 below previous year um seeing a high demand of essential goods and uh answering,with an ebit of 45 million swiss ranks 21 below previous year seeing a high demand of essential goods and,
um,000 teu less in our networks uh which resulted into um 11 70 reduction in quarter two and a 9 10,000 tu less in our networks which resulted into you know a strong demand for essential goods which were higher,
um,in the cost uh level per unit uh as well um the ebit per teu is well below our normal ebit,including the tailwind from fx or from currency we saw the ebit per tu is well below our normal ebit,
um,that we usually pursue uh the 80 to 100 uh um swiss francs teu ebit per teu but it s eca,that we usually pursue the 80 to 100 swiss bank s tu ebit per tu but it s recovering and,
um,and uh we also see some seasonal effects kicking in um we are focusing especially in sea logistics on excellent customer,bank s tu ebit per tu but it s recovering and we also see some seasonal effects kicking in less,
um,and the demand for higher yielding crisis goods has soared um the market demand has been much weaker in quarter two,based on a high demand for crisis goods but also a demand for special solutions such as sea and air,
um,weaker in quarter two as anticipated we have to say um the regular dry cargoes or the general cargo the normal,we are in a situation that the board of directors decided to propose for the general to propose the same,
um,minus 50 and this has been offset by crisis volumes um essential goods uh but not only crisis volumes um essential,profitability capacity has been down by minus 40 to minus 50 percent prices volumes essential goods but not only ppe,
um,volumes um essential goods uh but not only crisis volumes um essential goods uh but not only ppe uh but also,has been down by minus 40 to minus 50 percent prices volumes essential goods but not only ppe but also,
um,foo uh packaged food as well as e commerce volumes um went into into that um uh segment perishables were down,not only ppe but also package food as well as e commerce volumes went into that segment parachubists were down,
um,well as e commerce volumes um went into into that um uh segment perishables were down in april and may but,package food as well as e commerce volumes went into that segment parachubists were down in april and may but,
um,st back step by step as of june this year um we had a spike in charter business uh while belly,cargo or general cargo coming back step by step as of june had a spike in charter business while belly,
um,uh by a different way of producing air logistics and um our unit yield as you can see is clearly above,are skewed by a different way of producing air logistics and our unit yield as you can is clearly above,
um,is also above uh normal despite higher uh currency headwinds um and this marks a 50 increase in quarter two uh,tu is well below our normal ebit per tu but this includes also headwind from currency of 6 so in,
um,this is true bo for both intermodal as well as um truck brokerage we have seen slide 12 now we have,this is true for both intermodal as well as truck brokerage situation of volumes in europe at the start of,
um,april uh and especially intermodal more or less collapsed and um we see a steady recovery uh in june uh since,april and especially intermodal more or less collapsed and we see a steady recovery since june in europe in europe,
um,on a low level in the us at the moment um international and cross border which is a higher yielding business,on a low level in the us at the moment international and cross border which is the higher yielding business,
um,lagging but also here we see volumes uh coming back um all our networks have been maintained and we are ready,still lagging but also here we see volumes coming back all our networks have been maintained and we are ready,
um,and in some markets i will not say the geography um we have even uh had to reject certain volumes because,in some markets i will not say the geography we have even had to reject certain volumes because our networks,
um,filled again in june that s true for domestic transports um we saw a very strong growth in bookings uh on,filled again in june that s true for domestic transports we saw a very strong growth in bookings on our,
um,uh we have uh been able to roll this out um even uh in a in a virtual environment over the,very strong growth in bookings on our digital road platform called e truck now in a virtual environment over the,
um,in our best case scenario uh we would not have um expected a uh a positive quarter two in road logistics,to last year level that then compared to two day first quarter so we only if you like still a,
um,proud of what has been achieved here uh conque countering um uh volume reductions with cost measures slide 13 contract logistics,at the moment while ebit was 42 percent below countering volume reductions with cost measures live 13 contract logistics and,
um,of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable um um uh level again than prior to the crisis and,of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable and also e commerce and here the volumes were well,
um,the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable um um uh level again than prior to the crisis and there,the volumes have not recovered even to a sizable and also e commerce and here the volumes were well above,
um,details on the contract logistics business unit on slide 14 um the implementation of the covid 19 sops our operating procedures,detlef mentioned in contract logistics clear focus on on cost containment and cost management so a lot of times we,
um,efficiencies while we were doing everything to protect our staff um we lost clearly efficiencies uh cleaning disinfection between shifts no,we see a clear confirmation that 50 of our solution portfolio is related to essential cleaning disinfection between shifts no,
um,while the crisis becoming one uh so as of february um clearly showed progress and we were excluding the pressure from,shifts anymore segregation of workflow between shift led to a lower productivity and higher costs obviously excluding the pressure from,
um,clearly showed progress and we were excluding the pressure from um the uh exchange rate uh we were able to uh,led to a lower productivity and higher costs obviously excluding the pressure from the exchange rate we were able to,
um,that s a a huge effort and a great result um so the high portion in our solution portfolio of uh,that s a huge effort and a great result so the high portion in our solution portfolio of essential goods,
um,lease uh without any activity in too many sites nevertheless um uh we we saw a development end of quarter one,some seasonal effects kicking in less volume reductions than one might have expected from the market development and quarter the,
um,early quarter two but if you look into the figures um the uh overall performance uh including the fx effect uh,flow i think when you look at the curves on the page 19 on the right side there is no,
um,11 3 uh lower net turn over and in ebit um almost on the level of previous year quarter two and,11 3 lower net turnover and in ebit almost on the level of previous quarter two a very special second,
um,piece of hard work to uh to get that done um going further down in the uh p l of course,clear and the last one i didn t write down the last one okay and income from disposals oh income,
um,on a half year basis so 90 million nine zero um of which and that s not an excuse just the,and a half to four million on insurance premium i think that is given our sales ledger of more than,
um,also very apparent was even better than the first quarter um page number 17 let s talk about uh air and,very apparent was even better than the first quarter page number 17 let s talk about air and sea freight,
um,areas the one that is customer booking and order entry um i think the message here is yes do not extend,made pretty good progress at least in one i think the message here is yes we do not expect any,
um,is etouch is on track page number 18 balance sheet um i m only going to talk about uh uh three,is etouch is on track page number 18 balance sheet and i m three four components of course some of,
um,that position that is reducing the overall demand secondly and um arguably more important cash and cash equivalents i think our,to a situation that you can t really predict on slide 24 i want to make a couple of remarks,
um,million by the end of the first quarter 202 so um simple terms a very good uh uh development in uh,a never as of may so the figure you see is an average figure of a volume development that had,
um,a very good uh uh development in uh cash generation um in light i think of the decision and you have,which compares to roughly 900 million development in cash generation in light i think of the decision that you have,
um,time and that would still be positive with 280 million um just as a housekeeping topic here uh you re aware,read in the news 218 million just as a housekeeping topic here you re aware that we have a a,
um,the extent uh or at the frame of 750 million um coming back to uh the next item on the balance,the extent or at the frame of 750 million coming back to the next item on the balance sheet you,
um,balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king um so main topic cash uh going uh swiftly to page,benefit nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king so main topic cash going swiftly to page,
um,topic cash uh going uh swiftly to page number 1 um operational cash flow you can see that here in the,topic cash going swiftly to page number 19 operational cash flow you can see that here in around 666 million,
um,than last year uh with with around 800 872 million um however when we go down a little bit and look,that here in around 666 million be reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payment,
um,around 666 million be reminded at that point in time um that included last year a dividend payments to the amount,around 666 million be reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payment to the amount,
um,the very same level as as uh as last year um excluding some of the disposals and this gives you a,volume from lower perishables as that normalizes how we should be thinking to their covid crisis and have you seen,
um,we talked to you to uh uh uh disposals is um uh a very negligible i think 6 million out of,resilient free cash flow generation also in the second quarter is a very neglectable i think 6 million out of,
um,i think 6 million out of the free cash flow um for everybody who runs some of the models i think,think 6 million out of the free cash flow for everybody who run some of the models i think you,
um,i think you can see here from the investing activities um the cross capex the run rates or the capex that,think you can see here from the investing activities the cross capex the run rates of the capex that we,
um,we had it seen over the last couple of years um some of the some of the drivers of course is,road platform called e truck now in a virtual environment over the last couple of months in many asian countries,
um,according to ifrs 16 rather than uh uh outright purchases um looking at the pattern in time so the the trajectory,at i ll try to purchase looking at the pattern in time the trajectory of the free cash flow i,
um,touched uh the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet um when i when i talked about the balance sheet here,expect a more touched the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet when i talked about the balance sheet here,
um,so our net working capital is down around 146 million um what s more important our kpis and dsos and dpos,so our networking capital is down around 146 million and what s more important our kpis and dsos and dpos,
um,uh very clear yes there is but uh i think um uh we will see more pressure coming into third and,five percent for a simple reason because i believe that is anticipating a reflection of pressure on to risk and,
um,going forward for the next two to three quarters uh um an increase in the risk two to three quarters uh,going forward for the next two to three quarters an increase in the risk to three quarters an increase in,
um,an increase in the risk two to three quarters uh um an increase in the risk profile on counterparty risks um,an increase in the risk to three quarters an increase in the risk profile on counterparty risks profitability that we,
um,um an increase in the risk profile on counterparty risks um so nothing bad happened so far i want to underline,an increase in the risk profile on counterparty risks profitability that we have seen also on the p l on,
um,uh it s uh uh uh no uh no big um uh uh defaults or anything like that but i would,defaults or fallouts or bankruptcies or anything like that however the horizon is a bit darker than what it usually,
um,the year and maybe into the first half year 202 um return on capital employed uh page number 2 page number,ladies and gentlemen welcome to cuny and argle s half year 2020 results conference call i am sandra the course,
um,on capital employed uh page number 2 page number 21 um you see that little inflection point that we had here,page number 17 let s talk about air and sea freight in that context the e torch project and the,
um,uh is uh obviously mathematically leading to a bit of um uh a bit of an uh a compression on this,m a funds obviously you pay the dividend should be read into that that any m a ambitions are a,
um,around 70 return on capital employed that should be possible um the good news and at the same time i think,on the dso side days of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time i think,
um,news uh is on the next page page number 2 um uh dividend proposal just to put also some uh clarity,is obviously compression on this one however from a target perspective we maintain our financial our put also some clarity,
um,uh with the board of directors and the general assembly um that having said the actual payout ratio in the recent,power remains with the board of directors and the general assembly that having said the actual payout ratio in recent,
um,of around 75 of the uh net profit after tax um uh clearly uh now the bod s uh proposal is,our verbal communication to a distribution percent of the net profit after tax clearly now the bod s proposal is,
um,counterparty risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters um tax rate uh tax rate i think uh very important,to risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters tax rate i think very important to look at this,
um,to look at this one it s a housekeeping topic um for you also to uh update on your models uh,to look at this one it s a housekeeping topic for you also to update on your models we expect,
um,so just that you re not surprised on your models um right side the four business units you see the first,our latest communication this is just reflecting on your models right sides the four business units you see the first,
um,many of our peers uh we are not giving any um you know the uh i think the performance that the,the outlook with many of our peers we are not giving any you know i think the performance that the,
um,afternoon thanks for taking the question three if i may um could you elaborate what is enabling the market share game,afternoon thanks for taking the questions could you elaborate what is enabling the market share gain especially during a crisis,
um,in your view and kind of who s losing it um and then how much of that market share gain will,one in your view and kind of who s losing it and then how much of that market and how,
um,retain kind of as things move more back to normal um you also talked a little bit about your cost reduction,to look at this one it s a housekeeping topic for you also to update on your models we expect,
um,you showed about 87 000 employees down from about 98 um last year at the same point now how much of,666 million be reminded at that point in time that included last year a dividend payment to the amount of,
um,benefit you kind of as you ramp back up and um tying this also to etouch um back at the financial,benefit you kind of as you ramp back up and tying this also to e touch back at the financial,
um,ramp back up and um tying this also to etouch um back at the financial year logs you talked about 20,ramp back up and tying this also to e touch back at the financial results you talked about 20 million,
um,logs you talked about 20 million annualized savings so far um any indication on how this has progressed in the past,results you talked about 20 million annual life savings so far indication on how this has progressed in the past,
um,how this has progressed in the past six months and um you know do you expect that the automation will enable,how this has progressed in the past six months and you know do you expect that the automation will enable,
um,rate still very attractive to us and that is etouch um market share gains uh we have mentioned that uh we,rate still very attractive to us the whole organization into addressing actively customers after easter so we were engaged with,
um,because we changed the whole organization into addressing actively customers um after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers,to us the whole organization into addressing actively customers after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and,
um,easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and um potential customers target customers as we call them and we,after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and potential customers target customers as we call them and,
um,through worldwide over the last three four or five months um that proved to be a big risk and a big,it and operating it for one two or three months we want customers to stay with us and see how,
um,you had to prove your systems and technology are working um how much can we retain i would say we we,americas and we see that we have still volumes that are down and not recovering but here i would say,
um,solution portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts um i think um we have made a lot of efforts,solution portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts i think we have made a lot of efforts with,
um,generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts um i think um we have made a lot of efforts uh with all,portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts i think we have made a lot of efforts with all,
um,the essential goods uh segments especially uh pharma healthcare and um e commerce and this is from our point of view,programs that are in place but not only pharma healthcare and e commerce and this from our point of view,
um,rate so far across key markets okay so volume trends um which markets saw as you know the whole pandemic started,rate so far across key markets okay market or we are we have a much higher portion of of blue,
um,partly in in other markets but mainly in europe and um this this will take time it will not come overnight,higher portion of of blue chip customers there but in europe this will take time it will not come overnight,
um,this this will take time it will not come overnight um at the moment the pandemic uh is is hitting the,but in europe this will take time it will not come overnight at the moment the pandemic is hitting the,
um,three months ago when we discussed the quarter one results um i would say um despite regional and local setbacks um,three months ago when we discussed the quarter one results setbacks despite regional and local setbacks the pandemic is not,
um,we discussed the quarter one results um i would say um despite regional and local setbacks um this pa regional and,we discussed the quarter one results setbacks despite regional and local setbacks the pandemic is not over but we have,
um,um i would say um despite regional and local setbacks um this pa regional and local setbacks um the pandemic is,were three months ago when we discussed the quarter one results setbacks despite regional and local setbacks the pandemic is,
um,and local setbacks um this pa regional and local setbacks um the pandemic is not over but we have all managed,the quarter one results setbacks despite regional and local setbacks the pandemic is not over but we have all managed,
um,order to secure the people and make them continue consuming um the sge run rate uh it has a lot of,measures in order to secure the people and make them continue consuming the sge run rate has a lot of,
um,sge run rate uh it has a lot of components um laugh and uh it starts with travel for example i,make them continue consuming the sge run rate has a lot of components and it starts with travel for example,
um,as well there s a a currency effect in sge um because uh we translate everything into into hard currency swiss,a currency effect here as well has a currency effect in sge because we translate everything into hard currency swiss,
um,very much sure david so let me answer your questions um sea logistics um yes we had a better volume development,so let me answer your questions see logistics so it s a different business model you can t compare it,
um,david so let me answer your questions um sea logistics um yes we had a better volume development than expected uh,my side first on on sea logistics it turns out that the volume development is better than expected as the,
um,south america via air and this combination uh this solution um is in in light of the lacking supply side of,a good combination south america via air and this combination this solution in light of the lacking supply side of,
um,so this combination showed a certain uh progress air logistics um i think i mentioned that during the presentation we expect,so this combination showed a certain progress air logistics i think i mentioned that during the presentation we expect especially,
um,not uh on a on a fingertip but uh gradually um road logistics um i think uh our comps are uh,of sales outstanding important argument to maintain the dsos at the same time i think our focus moves towards the,
um,a on a fingertip but uh gradually um road logistics um i think uh our comps are uh we we have,not new assessment of values it s just an update on progress and i think you can appreciate we have,
um,what has happened or described really what has happened is um uh i think what we have to all all of,air freight can be described by just make it happen make it happen times where customers as much as on,
um,experienced in europe and then i come to the us um europe we have volume reductions of 50 60 within weeks,experience over the last six months or in the past in general they stay with us we have a lot,
um,on the uh seafreight conversion rate that s held up um pretty well but i guess there wasn t very much,one is on the cfrate conversion rate that s held up pretty well but i guess there wasn t any,
um,what what helped the uh conversion rate in the quarter um second question is on i think there was 57 million,that as it relates to gp deploy over the medium term and then the second question and i guess it,
um,divisions that came in was it mostly in contract logistics um and could you see that support be withdrawn um before,bills so it s cute the question on contract logistics and cost development the majority of the cost is people,
um,logistics um and could you see that support be withdrawn um before the market recovered back up to normal rates so,there wasn t any benefit from e touch in that segment the market recovers back up to normal rates so,
um,up to normal rates so there s basically a lag um and and your your profitability is impacted by that uh,market recovers back up to normal rates so there s basically a lag and your profitability is impacted by that,
um,and the last question will just be an update on um on m a plans obviously you paid the dividend it,and the last question would just be an update on m a funds obviously you pay the dividend should be,
um,paid the dividend it should be read into that that um any m a ambitions are a bit a bit less,funds obviously you pay the dividend should be read into that that any m a ambitions are a bit less,
um,m a ambition i m a bit surprised because our um proposal dividend proposal has not changed to the one that,a ambition i m a bit surprised because our proposal the dividend proposal has not changed to the one that,
um,for variety really so just just to come back on um on the airfreight and capacity question could you give us,hear just for variety really so just to come back on the air freight and capacity question could you give,
um,but much more of it is short and medium haul um rather than the long haul stuff which is typically what,but much more of it is short and medium hole rather than the long hole stuff which is typically what,
um,allows for uh belly uh using belly capacity again yeah um yeah and i and i and i supposed that and,allows for belly using belly capacity again yeah go ahead the 60 to 70 percent that you think is going,
um,all is freighter capacity so we have a lot of um uh belly still in north america or the americas which,almost all is greater capacity so we have a lot of bellies still in north america or the americas which,
um,where you stand on sort of credit insurance on the um on on debt just how much you use it thanks,for the one credit insurance on the on on debt is how much you use it thanks mark that i,
um,there are a lot of conversations going on right now um i don t want to say that insurers have all,so there s a lot of caution is going forward how much we pay you can see that of the,
um,so there s a lot of caution as going forward um how much we pay you can see that of the,so there s a lot of caution is going forward how much we pay you can see that of the,
um,comes from glynn neil from credit suisse please go ahead um hello um so nei neil from credit suisse hi uh,comes from clean neil from criticism please go ahead hello hello neil from credit suisse if i can ask firstly,
um,glynn neil from credit suisse please go ahead um hello um so nei neil from credit suisse hi uh if i,the next question comes from clean neil from criticism please go ahead hello hello neil from credit suisse if i,
um,ll have one for detlef too if i may ah um keep keep it to two so so the first one,ll have one for debt left too if i may keep it to two so the first one marcus you,
um,two so so the first one markus you ve obviously um spent some time talking about working capital and increasing risk,to two so the first one marcus you obviously customers just wondering as it pertains to see fright and the,
um,it relates to gp per teu over the medium term um and then the second question and i guess it could,relates to gp deploy over the medium term and then the second question and i guess it could be for,
um,the latter question if you if you don t mind um first of all we concentrate on our own business and,the letter question if you don t mind first of all we concentrate on our own business and optimizing our,
um,in airlog logistics as we as we have uh pronounced um m a is independent of this this needs cultural fit,in air logistic as we have pronounced certain asian customers a solution that is not yet part of our own,
um,approach or uh delay any m a it s more um getting acquainted to those ha i mean uh uh targets,is not a criteria that would mna approach or delay any mna it s more getting acquainted to those targets,
um,be able to announce the right or the right acquisitions um so neil then uh on the first question i i,view i m quite confident or the right acquisitions so neil then on the first question i think it s,
um,in seafreight is that temporarily there is going to be um a a shift in mix away from the sme but,even get a bigger portion of that and the profitability is going to be run exactly if not the both,
um,this is this is our backbone of our operation right um uh uh there is still a a massive potential to,customer base to the sme customer this is our backbone of our operation there is still a massive potential to,
um,the in a very profitable market in the sme so um how the margin is going to look like uh uh,to grow in a very profitable market in the sma so how the margin is going to look like i,
um,handelsbanken please go ahead thank you very much good afternoon um also a question regarding uh the mix shift in sea,from frant hoja from handelsbanken go ahead thank you very much good afternoon also a question regarding the mix shift,
um,question regarding uh the mix shift in sea towards sme um could you could you try and um describe how much,good afternoon also a question regarding the mix shift in c towards sme could you try and describe how much,
um,sea towards sme um could you could you try and um describe how much of a shift in the mix you,in c towards sme could you try and describe how much of a shift in the mix you saw and,
um,four six weeks and that has caused the reduction so um but we see them gradually coming back but as markus,four six weeks and that has caused the reduction so but we see them gradually coming back but as marcus,
um,s a result of the pandemic and not of a um how should i say conscious mix decision no i understand,a result of the pandemic and not of a conscious mixed decision and an uptake in the m a opportunities,
um,losing it are typically the small or mid sized uh um competitors uh that are having difficulties on the technology front,is typically what you use at the moment it s short and medium haul and that doesn t help us,
um,and so on and and you also talk about the um credit risks uh escalating so there might be an an,not of a conscious mixed decision and an uptake in the m a opportunities that you see maybe you can,

um,will not uh give any comments on on single forwarders um the quantification of the benefits from perishables first of all,will not give any comments on single forewaters the quantification of the benefits from perishables one third less perishables in,
um,was available or required or the rates spiked or not um we believe that this perishable volume comes back gradually in,was available or required or the rates spiked or not we believe that this perishable volume comes back in the,
um,second semester and there s thus the mix would reinstate um with a lower yield so the 70 to 85 uh,second semester and thus the mix would reinstate with a lower yield so the 70 to 85 swiss francs per,
um,have contributed to this development in the second quarter and um uh the other question i have if i calculated correctly,contributed to this development in the second quarter and the other question i have if i calculated correctly your conversion,
um,uh transport bills uh so it s skewed be careful um we have a we have a uh profit sharing models,where to you know invoice and pay transport bills so it s cute the question on contract logistics and cost,
um,or internally between regions so that will not really help um conversion rate for sure is influenced by uh the performance,exposure of that region so sebastian first of all we don t look at conversion rates per region because it,
um,two uh airfreight or air logistics has been extremely successful um the uh and the question on contract logistics and cost,where to you know invoice and pay transport bills so it s cute the question on contract logistics and cost,
um,exposure and the rest is uh capacity and we breezed um with the volume very well yes we did not have,was available or required or the rates spiked or not we believe that this perishable volume comes back in the,
um,if you look into china and china is maybe a um we can learn from china or asia because they went,opened yet and the rest is fully operational or a we can learn from china or asia because they went,
um,i hope that helps to answer your question it s um personal cost is the main factor and we are almost,as we thought helps to answer your question it s personal cost is the main factor and we are almost,
um,they awarded to us during the last especially last quarter um we will see how we progress over the next quarter,development also the demand for rail solution especially as china started to pick up strongly as of june last quarter,

um,morning chris good morning um thanks for taking my question um the first thing i wanted to start with was just,can good morning chris okay good morning thanks for taking my question down you see automotive 50 down you see,
um,but i wondered whether you could maybe conceptually talk through um 3q versus 4q and just versus 2q or any comments,i just wanted maybe peter if you could talk through the two queue moving parts obviously you ve stepped through,
um,half in terms of reduction in their shipments it is um you know it seems like it can be stronger than,we experienced in the second half into the reduction in their shipments it seems like it can be stronger than,
um,reason for that is it s a long supply chain um and the customers uh you know move a little bit,reason for that is it s a long supply chain and the customers move a little bit more slowly in,
um,little bit further on the second half of the year um and what the opportunities are that on working capital uh,little bit further on the second half of the year and what the opportunities are that i m working capital,
um,sure happy to do it and just for context so um the second quarter as we said last uh quarter we,slide 12 i want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the second quarter in the second quarter we,
um,in fact burned 63 million of working capital in the um in q2 and for the first half we re positive,to do it backburned 63 million of working capital in the nq2 and for the first half we re positive,
um,being uh used in the back half of the year um but chris i would say that uh we remain confident,of the year so not a huge negative but we could but chris i would say that we remain confident,
um,the past we got it removed it may come back um we think it s misguided and it doesn t address,past we ve got it removed it may come back we think it s misguided and it doesn t address,
um,i remind you that uh we pass through the metal um cost essentially to uh most of our customers there may,is coming to us in the u s through the u s that s great it s good to hear,
um,any comment around you know pricing strength yeah so we um so we don t go into the details of exactly,comment around pricing strength yeah so we see a lot of people who are but you know that we ve,
um,your line is open great thanks for taking my questions um first of all i did have one question on the,your line is open hey guys thanks for taking my questions and a really great job on transparency and costs,
um,helpful thank you and then just in terms of the um you know the the the individual uh and market commentary,and then i guess just in general in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out,
um,the or has been you know the highest margin business um and and you know just in terms of the outlook,these countries have economies that are based on tourism and you know this is not the best year for tourism,
um,will completely offset the recovery in auto and and packaging um in the second half or or or a bit more,believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery and auto and packaging in the second half for a bit more,
um,well okay and just m my last related question is um the the the i think you mentioned i think average,as well okay and just related the man in the second quarter was around 60 at your facilities is that,
um,you mentioned i think average utilization rates for aerospace related um demand in this in the second quarter was around 60,s something to factor in as well okay and just related the man in the second quarter was around 60,
um,can you give us an update on on those efforts um so um if we look if we look at the,of matthew fields from bank of america your line is open one on the markets and then one on the,
um,give us an update on on those efforts um so um if we look if we look at the uh i,line is open question on the numbers for the second quarter did you say there was a 15 million one,
um,some of that cost is gonna come back right so um you know i d say it s hard to give,some of that cost is going to come back right so you know i d say it s hard to,
um,it s uh it s a difficult one yeah okay um kurt if i may add uh we have talked about,really precise number on that kurt it s a difficult one kurt if i may add we have talked about,
um,the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we um lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities but how do,the strategic initially is was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities but how,
um,know kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis um and so that we don t take on any incremental,a free cash flow position thanks thanks peter that s the tip from me thank you good your next question,
um,you know in terms of the the free cash flow um you know dynamics you mentioned i think a 73 million,you know this is not the best year for tourism as we all know and we are seeing you know,
um,in a couple months i get that arrow is weaker um but it would seem like from a free cash flow,close to 90 utilization in a couple of months weaker but it would seem like from a free cash flow,
um,would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint um you know unless working capital would be a major negative,would seem like from a free cash flow generation standpoint unless working capital would be a major negative you should,
um,we re confident that we will generate free cash flow um for the full year um and you know the back,there s a very good chance that we can generate some free cash flow but it depends a lot on,
um,will generate free cash flow um for the full year um and you know the back half of the year i,all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year yes sure thanks for the question so,
um,little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp um and the consequences of the ramp um but again for,on a ppe and e and in the case of the german ones one of them is secured and one,
um,of the ramp um and the consequences of the ramp um but again for the full year we we remain confident,of the year so not a huge negative but we could but chris i would say that we remain confident,
um,a clean slate entering 202 so you know is that um statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut,right so you know i d say it s hard to give a really precise number on that kurt it,
um,in general in the supply chain and so you know um hypothetically your your volumes would be below the actual build,i said we ve got the ramp of these businesses so hypothetically your volumes would be below the actual bill,
um,clean slate comment well yeah uh no fair question so um i think i ve commented in the past on the,help them clear inventory well yeah no fair question so i think i ve commented in the past on the,
um,a t that s that s one of the goals um in terms of what we re getting from uh the,21 will be in anp that s one of the goals in terms of what we re getting from the,

um,and um and well eugenio welcome welcome on board so um my my one question would be on the more recent,okay and you re welcome aboard so my one question would be on the more recent performance in oxxon you,
um,my my one question would be on the more recent um performance in oxxo and you ve elaborated how it went,aboard so my one question would be on the more recent performance in oxxon you ve elaborated how it went,
um,with us on the uh the the temporary store closures um how many you you currently still have closed and how,into the orange face some of the re openings store closures how many you currently still have closed and how,
um,is is is coming still but but there s still um uh if we you know if we uh uh we,bit it s coming still but there s still you know if we just pay attention yesterday to the google,
um,going to happen with school systems in the next uh um uh quarter uh what s going to happen with with,going to happen with school systems in the next quarter what s going to happen with offices opening or keeping,
um,in the way that we are understanding the pandemic better um you know uh i could tell that the uh lack,it closed speaking the way that we are understanding the pandemic better you know i could tell that the lack,
um,i could tell that the uh lack of contagious of um um um of this uh pandemic in the stores is,the pandemic better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is,
um,could tell that the uh lack of contagious of um um um of this uh pandemic in the stores is very,pandemic better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is very,
um,tell that the uh lack of contagious of um um um of this uh pandemic in the stores is very low,better you know i could tell that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is very low,
um,to accomplish the the objectives not necessarily by by by um unstabilizing the the the way we we we work with,to prepare ourselves with the good inventories and but again the so those two were major they have major effects,
um,the the way we we we work with the stores um uh i think another problem is really through the lockdown,the so those two were major they have major effects on it in the other hand i think the traditional,
um,and the social distancing night shifts are very very weak um and and we have had some uh besides the the,that the lack of contagious of these pandemic in the stores is very low very very low and we are,
um,uh uh future yeah i i think i would add um uh miguel this is juan um even on the on,we look forward with a very optimistic future i think i would add let me get this one on the,
um,think i would add um uh miguel this is juan um even on the on the jetro restaurant depot which is,very optimistic future i think i would add let me get this one on the jeta restaurant depot which is,
um,uh the little restaurants adapting to you know curbside delivery um and things begin to open up in many of the,customers as well the little restaurants adapting to curbside delivery and things begin to open up in many of the,
um,so overall i would say on the restaurant depot front um you know a positive surprise great thank you both crosstalk,these investments i would say there s probably one exception you know the jan platform you know a big part,
um,first one the the pension reform i think it is um this hole led there and i think it s a,answer the first one the pressure reform i think is this whole web there and i think it s a,
um,right thing to do and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh uh private companies and the government,but i think it s what the right nothing to do and nothing between the private companies and the government,
um,well as developing the digital uh platforms across the board um we have had some uh closures of stores uh and,the software as well as developing the digital platforms across the board we have had some closures of stores and,
um,with different offerings to to really estimate dema the demand um and here we are uh we have our our our,with different offerings to really just to make them demand and here we have our suppliers and our partners and,
um,uh supplier partners right now as eduardo ha has said um you know i m i think a positive surprise has,we receive from our from our supplier partners right now as eduardo has said i think a positive surprise has,
um,know uh faster growth of financial services during the downturn um as consumers have kind of made sure that they re,know faster growth of financial services during the downturn as consumers have kind of made sure that they re keeping,
um,with their with their memberships and their utilities and and um you know realizing or or taking advantage of the fact,sure that they re keeping current with their memberships and their utilities and realizing or taking advantage of the fact,
um,uh some of those agreements as eduardo also referred to um are are tied to to volume and so it s,stores also we are really imposing some of the nice sheets because again there there is no consumers around but,
um,is is not as clear as as we would like um i wouldn t necessarily predict at this point that we,where returnable soft drinks is not as strong as we should have it now and those kind of sheets we,
um,this point that we will continue to to expand it um you know more than more than trend uh but at,of thing so so we re we re still not at the end of this but we know more about,
um,shift demand to uh to some other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh have uh uh that compensated the margin,shift the man to some of the alcoholic beverages and those have let s say demarcated a little bit too,
um,to uh higher consumption of spirits uh during the quarter um and interestingly i think what what the oxxo uh our,the high but at least during the second quarter it did kind of hold its own thank you i think,
um,mobility will stay for a very long period of time um uh which we not which we we don t think,unless we think that this lack of community will stay for a very long period which we don t think,
um,adapt better and we have to adapt more to the um to the um um lack of of of consumer economic,case i think we have to adapt there and we have to adapt more to the lack of consumer economic,
um,we have to adapt more to the um to the um um lack of of of consumer economic uh power and,we have to adapt more to the lack of consumer economic power by probably with a different assortment probably looking,
um,have to adapt more to the um to the um um lack of of of consumer economic uh power and and,have to adapt more to the lack of consumer economic power by probably with a different assortment probably looking for,
um,the looking for for cheaper or or less expensive products um our returnable uh uh cun uh uh uh soft drinks,economic power by probably with a different assortment probably looking for cheaper or less expensive products where returnable soft drinks,
um,touched on it in his uh opening remarks was that um the quarter itself was a little bit of a uh,kind of highlight and i think eduardo touched on it in his opening itself was a little bit of a,
um,the of the trend was was the month of may um and we believe that uh we hope and believe that,the trough of the trend was the month of may and we believe of may and then as the beer,
um,of this downturn uh should be the month of may um and then as as beer comes back uh it it,the trend was the month of may and we believe of may and then as the beer comes back it,
um,uh uh a more traditional downturn so so to speak um and so you know the uh as eduardo said in,and generally begins to turn this into a more traditional downturn so to speak and so as i said in,
um,beer front uh working hard to restock the the shelves um consumers themselves are are probably buying a little bit more,for the call most of my questions have been answered but if i may just insist a little bit more,
um,on on some of these uh important categories especially beer um so i would expect that to to continue and uh,once the mobility restrictions of packaging and mix for some important categories i think we need to be careful and,
um,uh packaging and and and mix for some important categories um i think we need to to be careful and work,the mobility restrictions of packaging and mix for some important categories i think we need to be careful and work,
um,know some incremental skus or a shift in the mix um and that sort of thing so so we re we,know some incremental skus or a shift in the mix and that sort of thing so so we re we,
um,uh adjusting habits than we did a couple months ago um and we are acting in in consequence unk yeah unk,but we know more about adjusting habits than we did a couple months ago and we are acting in consequence,
um,morning hope you guys are and your families are safe um eduardo or juan um i guess i mean we on,good morning hope you guys are in your families one also gets a lot of it s why they re,
um,are and your families are safe um eduardo or juan um i guess i mean we on the sell side most,morning hope you guys are in your families one also gets a lot of it s why they re reluctant,
um,closed stores uh so i guess the specific question is um and and sorry if i missed it uh what what,investors you asked me the question of you know is it possible to have a long term partners can make,
um,is why the reluctance to stay away from e commerce um and invest here in job you ve been saying every,why they re reluctant to stay away from e commerce i invest really jokes with me saying every time you,
um,that that will help us to be on track again um um in terms of of your question about the e,that category i think you also touched on the second part of your question on the categories for brazil logistics,
um,that will help us to be on track again um um in terms of of your question about the e commerce,that we have make us very it goes on and and and i think it s a if you found,
um,loyalty program is related and connected with the international platform um we we uh the current the current uh the if,run i think we have a good public platform and it s just that we have the current platforms like,
um,i think at the at the top mm hmm affirmative um and i think what we re doing right now is,business where you took kind of opso into drugstores so i think what we re doing right now and i,
um,with about 150 stores outside of mexico so i think um we are in the early stages of that process where,with about 150 stores outside of mexico so i think we are in the early stages of that process where,
um,of mexico where uh the fact that you now have um the abi portfolio uh kind of takes a lot of,the valley of mexico where the fact that you now have the adi portfolio kind of takes a lot of,
um,that were just short of being viable makes them viable um and again kind of uh you know ensures that we,that will be temporary and we are adapting the best we can thank you very much you know we re,
um,large numbers of stores in that part of the country um i think on the e commerce front i mean eduardo,are more designed to serve people that are on the go but i think that will take more time and,
um,the potential and the power of of the oxxo platform um to bankarize people or to get people to adopt uh,the fact that it s a lot easier to go to oxo than to go to the bank and it,
um,to get people to sign up and and adopt uh um new new means of payment or new means of of,to get people to sign up and adopt new means of payment or new means of saving but one thing,
um,you know you ve seen us for over the years um femsa basically has a couple of ways that that we,mean you ve seen us for over the years femsa so basically it has a couple of ways that we,
um,a couple of degrees and examples of of this abound um whether you re talking about jugos del valle or santa,a couple of degrees and examples of this bound whether you re talking about hugo del valle or santa clara,
um,that we made a couple of investments in the us um or how does the the jan san business fit into,we made a couple of investments in the u s or how does the janssen business fit into the overall,
um,the the jan san business fit into the overall strategy um i think you re seeing us do kind of what,how does the janssen business fit into the overall strategy i think you re seeing us do kind of what,
um,another country obviously with the benefit of very strong partners um as we have in in in the us um so,another country obviously with the benefit of very strong and when we ve spoken about how we re going to,
um,partners um as we have in in in the us um so we understand that we you know we we are,partnerships that we have here in the united states we re very optimistic we have two great customers we have,
um,little bit of complexity to the to the org chart um we will try to address that uh to the extent,little bit of a strong the scripture but certainly the trough of the trend was the month of may and,
um,the jan san business uh first quarter of next year um so you know capital deployment uh these investments and and,the janssen business first quarter of next year of deployment these investments and addressing the complexity that it brings to,
um,20 000 uh bricks and mortar stores that we have um which are a differentiating factor vis a vis other folks,frankly the 20 000 bricks and mortar stores that we have which are differentiating factor we have the other folks,
um,go to rodrigo echagaray of scotiabank thank you uh guys um thanks for taking my question just wanted to hear your,to rodrigo ecajare of scotiabank thank you guys thanks for taking my question i just wanted to hear your thoughts,
um,lack of beer and that was uh uh uh uh um and and and and also the lack of cigarettes because,where hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was and also the lack of cigarettes because,
um,i think we were able to to uh to uh um prepare ourselves with good inventories and but again the uh,i think we were able to prepare ourselves with the good inventories and but again the so those two were,
um,on that uh in the other hand i think the um the traditional mom and pops are closed where people live,have major effects on it in the other hand i think the traditional modern pubs are closed where people leave,
um,and and just related to the last question i guess um you you have uh taken some stakes in in certain,during these initial periods of their downturn great thank you question i guess you have taken some stakes in certain,
um,you have uh taken some stakes in in certain startups um and i have seen that uh one of those uh,you have taken some stakes in certain startups and i ve seen that one of those who still has been,
um,become larger and in fact we did that with a um a great supplier that we have with this caffenio which,to become larger and in fact we did that with a great supplier that we had with new scaffanio which,
um,uh uh support to them so this pandemic we also um uh we we all the small uh uh vendors we,that knowledge we could be of great support to them so this pandemic we also all the small vendors we,
um,i think on the on the uh justo or justo um investment i mean certainly we re we re trying to,i think on the oxford front they have continued to invest in their new versions of some of the software,
um,that we operate and certainly uh distribution the use of um you know dark dark warehouses or dark kitchens dark stores,that we do not just in the distribution part but also on the work housing side in fact if you,
um,you know dark dark warehouses or dark kitchens dark stores um the handling of perishables uh these are all things that,has been an easy to ensure part of the behavior of the competitors and these are major the strength that,
um,tur it turned out to be uh an interesting one um i mean the the the the the amounts involved are,don t know if you want to add to this one i mean just the point that i think on,
um,assets you you bought over the last couple of years um those are my two questions thank you well the heineken,the different assets you bought over the last couple of years it doesn t have two questions well the heineken,
um,deploy that capital in a better way and and and um it it is it it is as as not as,we just have to find a way to deploy that capital in a better way and it is not as,
um,to uh deploy that capital and and and have that um um use of those proceeds um the the second question,to deploy that capital in a better way and it is not as optimal as it was in the past,
um,uh deploy that capital and and and have that um um use of those proceeds um the the second question uh,to deploy that capital in a better way and it is not as optimal as it was in the past,
um,and and have that um um use of those proceeds um the the second question uh i forgot uh juan would,a long time that s the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest,
um,after a lot of activity on the m a front um and i think i mean i i think that the,well to find the problem that we are left out in the country and i think by testing that we,
um,on the promise of uh of all of these investments um i would i would say there there s probably one,synergies and kind of delivering on the promise of all of these investments i would say there s probably one,
um,part of the of the attractiveness of that business involves um a growth through acquisitions and eventual integration and you know,part of the attractiveness of that business involves a growth through acquisitions and eventually integration of integration and you know,
um,in the coming months and quarters but if they were um i think we would be interested in taking looks uh,in the coming months and quarters but if they were i think we would be interested in taking looks our,
um,kind of sitting a little bit more on our hands um and digesting the the the number of bites that we,sitting a little bit more on our hands and digesting the number of bites that we took over the last,
um,over the last 18 months yes and alvaro eh uh um uh thinking about the fourth platform that we are looking,over the last 18 months yes i m thinking about the fourth platform that we re looking at and i,
um,have is is already well well established the proximity health um uh and and um uh and now this jan san,vector for growth was published the proximity health and now these young people from i think we are we will,
um,well well established the proximity health um uh and and um uh and now this jan san platform i think we,vector a different vector for growth was published the proximity health and now these young people from i think we,
um,and competencies to suit the assortment for an economic downturn um lack of mobility is it will be uh uh different,with the lack of consumer economics time but what we re trying to do is to come up with different,
um,of of of for for that uh pantry uh uh um uh well to find the product you are that that,a good assortment for that country well to find the problem that we are left out in the country and,
um,have be uh good prices but i think that category um it will um if lack of mobility will be in,think by testing that we have a good price but i think that category lack of mobility will be in,
um,good prices but i think that category um it will um if lack of mobility will be in place we ll,good price but i think that category lack of mobility will be in place we ll have to expand that,
um,ll have to expand that category compared with the uh um uh uh quench or or or some other categories that,will be in place we ll have to expand that category compared with the quench or some other categories that,
um,will be interesting for all of us to to see um whether you know the consumer begins to privilege proximity even,will i m sure adapt our valuable position to that whether it means you know some incremental skus or a,
um,good our pricing is uh for for that uh category um i think you also touched on on the second part,an assortment and how good our pricing is for that category i think you also touched on the second part,
um,of your question on uh the categories for brazil logistics um i think generally as we have been moving uh towards,second part of your question on the categories for brazil logistics i think generally as we have been moving towards,
um,pharma uh is an industry that is very well suited um for the for the type of uh logistics that that,business and specialized workhousing certainly pharma is an industry that is very well suited for the type of logistics that,
um,and the and kind of the volume and the cost um and and the type of uh conditions that they require,like what i ve been learning i think the consumers so the consumer can do the better decision for their,
um,will come from carlos laboy of hsbc good morning everyone um john and uh constant hi carlos hi eduardo john and,will come from carlos loboy of hsbc good morning everyone about the long term clarity of profit split with the,

um,um you you you pointed out that you expect further um complications in the next couple of quarters given uh falling,best interest margin and you pointed out that you expect further complications in the next couple of quarters given falling,
um,given uh falling grades and weak uh loan demands and um mixed deterioration um as as you look at 2021 uh,given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you look at 2021 in the context of what,
um,grades and weak uh loan demands and um mixed deterioration um as as you look at 2021 uh in the context,of quarters given falling rates and weak loan demand and mixed deterioration as you look at 2021 in the context,
um,possible that we re likely to see another year of um nii compression and and to to what extent that can,and for nii i d like you to see another year of nii compression and to what extent that can,
um,in the pml and and my second question is on um the on the coverage ratio and i and i know,that can be offset elsewhere in the pml and my second question is on the coverage ratio and i know,
um,normally don t target a coverage ratio i get it um but but evidently the the the size of your reserves,know that banks normally don t target a coverage ratio i get it but evidently the size of your reserves,
um,of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring um and so when i look at your capex ratio at,of the amount of loans that are on their restructuring and so when i look at your complex ratio of,
um,know take a much bigger charge on provisions this quarter um you know evidently there is there s there s a,know take a much bigger charge more in the battle and so is this piecemeal just going to you know,
um,there s there s a lot of uncertainty ahead and um the more the better a and and so is this,there s still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that probably the most severe numbers in terms of,
um,you know r raise your coverage to north of 200 um and and is that likely maybe something you will do,you know raise your coverage to north of 200 percent and if i d like you may have something to,
um,something you will do in the third quarter thank you um look jorge i will ask um this is hector i,like you may have something to do with the third order thank you look okay i will ask this sector,
um,third quarter thank you um look jorge i will ask um this is hector i will ask um i will answer,third order thank you look okay i will ask this sector i will ask them to answer the first part,
um,i will ask um this is hector i will ask um i will answer the first part and then i will,look okay i will ask this sector i will ask them to answer the first part and then i will,
um,complete on the on the basic numbers of nii okay um i mean first of all i mean if if you,operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean first of all i mean not traveling and not doing many,
um,saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of um of the credit loan portfolio okay first of all i,it is then you can expect that we can basically have good numbers there i don t think we re,
um,the credit loan portfolio okay first of all i mean um if you have seen i mean uh we have decreased,bank quite significantly i mean first of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things basically have reduced,
um,sense uh that basically is a high yield portfolio which um is going to continue to shrink unless we we see,sense that basically is a high portfolio it s going to continue to shrink unless we see some guarantees from,
um,we are very s strict on pricing risk okay so um we ve been increasing the margin on the corporate loans,we are very strict on pricing risk okay so we ve been increasing the margin on the corporate loans quite,
um,in terms of what you were asking in terms of um the reserves uh we maybe we ve actually been doing,we see nii evolving in terms of what you were asking in terms of the reserves we actually been doing,
um,with the data uh hopes that we have in reviewing um the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided,a tremendous job with the data hopes that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays clusters have been divided,
um,be very conservative in the way we manage that okay um didier i don t know if you want to complete,be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points we re working currently on that,
um,eh great talking to you jorge long time no speak um eh in terms of uh eh nims you know eh,on what you mentioned great talking to you jorge a long time no speak in terms of names you know,
um,think it s it s eh it s quite relevant um the the speed at which interest rates have come down,and let me just give you some background information that i think it s quite relevant those rates were coming,
um,and relative to the second quarter of last year okay um also bear in mind that when interest rates were close,year and relative to the second quarter of last year of that you have the change in mix on our,
um,portfolio is 96 billion over the last 12 months so um what we expect coming down the road you know pay,portfolio did not enroll in the support programs so what we re seeing you know this slide the tradition has,
um,in line with the expected losses that we we estimate um you know you might have a or you might question,with the expected losses that we estimate you know you might have a you know a or you might question,
um,so eh yet you know the the inaudible bank inaudible um they released in the stability financial stability report published a,so we ll start you know they have the exposure that they have with us the relationship that they have,
um,much uh npl ratios rate for the entire banking system um for consumer loans that would imply a 32 increase for,what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for the last 20 years and they you,

um,conservative as we can in order to manage it so um and if we see that the portfolio continues to deteriorate,conservative as we can in order to manage it so and if we see that the portfolio that continues to,
um,when the first loans that went into the holiday start um to to mature and we we see that we see,when the first loans that went into the pending holiday start and we see the we will see how the,
um,of the bank i mean our top exposure to airlines um is not big i mean compared to the top of,of the bank i mean compared to the total size of the portfolio i would say probably the year knows,
um,one inaudible in terms of the competition of mortgage loans um it s quite important what we do uh uh we,it s going to be a particular situation food and beverage it s quite important what we do we have,
um,is more resilient in this particular situations and also that um we get the best client because those are the ones,is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we get the best client because those are the ones,
um,is gonna behave well and is going to be managed um or is going be um behave in a nice in,so that s why the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well behaving in a nice in a nice in,

um,regarding liquidity pay pay i think that the the most um uh relevant is our you know how we fund a,regarding liquidity ratio and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we,
um,inaudible and fundamental way of uh looking at it then um as you rightly mentioned the um the debt issuance is,see the so i think that it do not surprise us you know we mentioned that given this deterioration of,
um,looking at it then um as you rightly mentioned the um the debt issuance is uh you know contributed significantly to,think that that s going to be one of the products most impacted you don t you know you continue,
um,a contraction in deposits that we re not seeing that um and i think that the bank has uh managed um,that we have that we re not seeing that and i think that the bank has managed quite proactively you,

um,the old accounting and if the balance of natls there um may may become losses i would appreciate thank you um,the old accounting and if the balance of anything of their need become losses i would appreciate it thank you,
um,um may may become losses i would appreciate thank you um hi yuri uh in terms of uh the npl ratio,balance of anything of their need become losses i would appreciate it thank you hi yuri from 2 61 to,
um,a miss basically going from 2 61 to 3 37 um as as we discuss uh during the quarter during the,yuri from 2 61 to 3 37 as we discussed during the call the vast majority of our loan portfolio,
um,as we discuss uh during the quarter during the call um uh you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio,as we discussed during the call the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enroll in the support programs,
um,to the other accounting criteria so uh the previous accounting um before inaudible the new regulation for for covid um you,re comparing you know the special account criteria to the other accounting criteria before the same regulation for covid you,
um,accounting um before inaudible the new regulation for for covid um you have like a table uh on your release uh,accounting criteria before the same regulation for covid you have like a table on your release comparing the special accounting,
um,it makes sense you know to to expect them worsening um on that you know i think that that uh you,it makes sense to expect some worsening on that dependent on the level of or the type of assumptions that,
um,okay so it it has to do with you know um with the um uh special accounting criteria you basically uh,paying their interest in capital stays current you you know and under all the prevailing accounting criteria you know you,
um,it has to do with you know um with the um uh special accounting criteria you basically uh allow clients not,that and that you know i don t know exactly what you re comparing you know the special account criteria,

um,facebook twitter uh ad boycotts all of that fun stuff um you guys are the largest you guys have a pretty,facebook twitter as it relates to core political if that stays in the digital bucket or if you can pick,
um,greater than what uh standard programming was generating al alone um so that s uh a very positive initial indication we,different than that of the mvtds and obviously we are still getting an uplift from the virtual mvpds so that,
um,the newsnation uh primetime uh offering and uh and so um what we could really use is you know an upfront,willing to pay for and so i think we ll just stand by that you know it s a lot,
um,we do anticipate an incremental let s call it low um eight figure uh revenue contribution to wgn s ad revenue,we do anticipate an incremental let s call it low contribution to wgn s and distribution that will mostly come,
um,four months of the of the end of this year um and again given the size and scope of the operation,have some that will be up end of this year and early next year and that s where those conversations,
um,say the vast majority of that impact would be felt um in uh in uh in 202 and again you re,year but i would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt in 2021 and again you re,

um,feel for the momentum in that particular area uh yeah um we we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with,field for the momentum in that particular area yeah we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with verify during,
um,the quarter they were up 50 uh year over year um in q2 uh that s mainly due to the fact,verify during the quarter they were up 50 year over year in q2 that s mainly due to the fact,
um,of the installs uh in the latter half of 201 um the interesting part about that business is that they they,the fact we had more equipment out there of 2019 the interesting part about that business is that they tend,
um,use the trucks on any job that have verifi so um our our trucks go out first with the verifi units,use the trucks on any job that have verify so our trucks go out first with the verify units on,
um,so we didn t really see a lot of decline um of usage of the verifi units uh during the quarter,we didn t really see a lot of decline of usage of the verify units during the quarter and certainly,
um,that s where we ve got most of our units um so that s why we had the 50 pop in,that s where we ve got most of our units so that s that s why we had the 50,

um,uh ihs and others that come up with the data um were tend to be if you wanna think about it,ahead hi good morning morning mike cfo thank you mike i wanted to ask if you can talk about it,
um,also and that s a big part of our business um we re pretty um confident that infrastructure uh governments uh,also and that s a big part of our business we re pretty confident that infrastructure governments you know may,
um,a big part of our business um we re pretty um confident that infrastructure uh governments uh you know you know,residential also and that s a big part of our business we re pretty confident that infrastructure governments you know,
um,strong so i think we re in good shape there um commercial could be slightly slower uh just you know you,going strong so i think we re in good shape there commercial could be slightly slower just you know you,
um,seen the retail news uh you know there s obviously um uh some reconsideration on office space on what you really,know you ve seen the retail news you know there s obviously some reconsideration office space on what you really,
um,in negotiation yeah i think if you look at the um um uh the pipeline 163 million that we re looking,they re kind of right on top of each other in terms of the new acquisitions that we re looking,
um,negotiation yeah i think if you look at the um um uh the pipeline 163 million that we re looking at,re kind of right on top of each other in terms of the new acquisitions that we re looking at,
um,fives is is where on average those are gonna be um are you nick i guess i guess i m more,fives is where on average those are going to be are you i guess i guess okay i m more,
um,i would say the cap rates in in those buildings um are in the similar range uh to what we have,i would say the cap rates in those buildings are in a similar range to what we have under contract,
um,early and and we re in discussions with those sellers um there are some that sometimes may fall out or take,early and we re in discussions with those sellers there are some that sometimes may fall out or take longer,
um,think it s that number is is a strong number um just in general if you think about productivity going into,taken a hit and were helped a lot by the cares act and cms in general but i do think,
um,helpful and you mentioned the portfolios on the market today um you know what would make you more interested is it,think it s not 50 50 if that helps you you know what would make you more interested is it,
um,in executing on those uh yeah i d say that um uh rather than pricing just the markets and the systems,you more interested in executing on those and i think that s where these portfolios that are out there they,
um,markets and the systems that they re uh associated with um the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth um,markets and into attractive growing msas with significant opportunities for future investment additionally we took a deeper dive in due,
um,um the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth um uh is really a a key piece uh that we,just wondering if there s actually some opportunity for some outside there as well thank you very much on the,
um,know the on adjacent makeup versus versus the off makeup um typically what you see is is you know there s,i do think i mean i think maybe what s in your question too sort of you know are we,
um,sense and you know the inaudible transaction the atlanta transaction um three years ago you know was a great example of,and the meta is an only transaction the atlanta a transaction three years ago is a great example of that,
um,years ago you know was a great example of that um you know we we certainly looked at the duke transaction,the atlanta a transaction three years ago is a great example of that we certainly looked at the duke transaction,

um,you re seeing uh again continued demand for the product um there ha ha has been a few buyers that are,asset class and so you re seeing continued demand for the product there has been a few buyers that are,
um,that you know that 5 1 2 range for typical um you know mobs and portfolios is very consistent over the,that underscores that five and a half range for typical mobs and portfolios is very occasionally you see deviations from,
um,stanley please go ahead uh thanks for taking the question um this first one you know you had a nice uh,stanley please go ahead thanks for taking the question you know you had a nice improvement on the fad payout,
um,had a nice uh improvement on the first day out um and you highlighted where you think it s going to,had a nice improvement on the fad payout and you highlighted where you think this could kind of end up,
um,i ll touch on it maybe you jumped in but um remember we re all uh social distancing so we re,i ll touch on it maybe you jump in but remember we re to not talk over each other which,
um,to maintain that level if not improve it each year um but you know as chris also talked about we ve,to maintain that level if not improve it each year but you know as chris also talked about we ve,
um,our plans together for 21 later this year okay great um and then todd is sorry go ahead i think todd,plans together for 21 later this year okay great and then todd it s sorry go ahead i think todd,
um,i i don t see any any major shifts there um but if we don t see the continued improvement that,don t see any major shifts there but if we don t see the continued improvement that we have been,
um,to absorption and new leasing which is which is great um for longterm in terms of of uh earnings and such,tied to absorption and new leasing which is great for long term in terms of earnings and such but could,
um,such but uh but could you know slow the momentum um temporarily in terms of of continued driving that payout ratio,in terms of earnings and such but could slow the momentum temporarily in terms of continued driving that payout ratio,
um,the in the right direction okay great and then just um uh you know on the a bit more color on,in the in the right direction okay great and then just you know on a little bit more color on,
um,you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus um i m just wondering through covid are there you know,you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus i m just wondering through covid are there you know,
um,then i can add to it yeah i think that um when you look at the at the current pipeline uh,and then i can add to it definition and i think those are kind of similar to what you ve,
um,heard us say in the past vikram about strong markets um that are markets where we already have investment uh and,heard us say in the past dick from about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment and,
um,that are markets where we already have investment uh and um you know i think that s where if we are,about strong markets that are markets where we already have investment and that think that s where if we are,
um,us you know even with what s going on now um obviously like everyone we re gonna be watching all the,us you know even with what s going on now obviously like everyone we re gonna be watching all the,
um,exposed to certain markets in the northeast new york boston um you know great cities obviously but there are some some,markets that that we trust and and you know are constantly trying to get those sellers to the table so,
um,over time with with all this demand and so forth um less about healthcare there but i would say we really,this and and so i think we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally,
um,with key keybanc capital markets please go ahead thank you um first i just wanna follow up on the uh the,with key bank capital markets please go ahead great i m not sure if i m overly reading into your,

um,coming and setting us up well for for 202 so um i think that s why we we have the confidence,not sitting around thinking about cap rates for mobs but i think there s gonna be there are gonna be,
um,s not you know we we certainly are encouraged that um you know we would like to you know go after,they measure up we certainly go after them and we certainly are encouraged that we would like to go after,
um,us to do stick to the quality side of things um but we re encouraged by you know the productivity and,us to do stick to the the side of things but we re encouraged by the productivity and the effectiveness,
um,think we will we will skew towards on an adjacent um versus off but you know again we re we re,think we will skew towards on and adjacent versus off but again we re okay with off touched on that,
um,today we sit closer to almost 90 on an adjacent um we have done a fair bit of adjacent um as,would say today we sit closer to almost 90 an adjacent we have done a fair bit of adjacent as,
um,adjacent um we have done a fair bit of adjacent um as you kind of point out and and sometimes you,adjacent we have done a fair bit of adjacent as you kind of point out and sometimes you is those,
um,you know you can go in and target and get um um you know really get those assets more regularly and,you can go in and target and really get those assets more regularly regularly and you know the on campus,
um,know you can go in and target and get um um you know really get those assets more regularly and you,are the ones that you can go in and target and really get those assets more regularly regularly and you,
um,i think we we maybe last year hit around 25 um you know off so we re okay with that it,off fluctuating i think we ve we maybe last year hit around 25 off so we re okay with that,
um,an on an adjacent though okay and then lastly like um maybe for chris on the cap rates um i i,okay with that on an adjacent though and then lastly like maybe for chris on the cap rates i i,
um,lastly like um maybe for chris on the cap rates um i i ve got the cash cap rates i m,and then lastly like maybe for chris on the cap rates i i ve got the cash cap rates i,
um,m kind of curious you mentioned the escalators on mercy um can you give me the gap cap rate on that,m kind of curious you mentioned the escalators on mercy can you give me the gap cap rate on at,
um,gap cap look on the acquisition as well yeah on um on mercy the the gap and cash were pretty close,and gap gap groups look on the acquisition as well yeah on mercy the gap and cash were pretty close,
um,about at the midpoint of the of the lease term um so they re they re kind of right on top,and cash were pretty close to the same because we were about at they re kind of right on top,
um,they re kind of right on top of each other um in terms of the the new acquisitions that we re,they re kind of right on top of each other in terms of the new acquisitions that we re looking,
um,is you know that two eight to two nine range um in terms of escalators and uh you know it it,is called you know the 2 8 to 2 9 range in in terms of escalators and it varies on,
um,say the gap adds about 25 to 50 basis points um uh to the to the cap rate on a gap,general we typically say the gap adds about 25 to 50 basis points to to cap rate on a gap,
um,you really look at the change in our guidance on um on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this,for some outside there as well thank you very much on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this,
um,more in line with what we had seen pre covid um last quarter we we were taking we didn t wanna,back more in line with what we had seen pre covid last quarter we were taking we didn t want,
um,we were taking we didn t wanna be overly aggressive um you know not having uh a lot of of leasing,last quarter we were taking we didn t want to be overly aggressive and not having a lot of leasing,
um,of what was going on and so we had taken um had taken down our expectations but as uh as we,of what was going on releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you know things have really shown great,
um,uh worked releases during the quarter and continued our discussions um you know things have have really shown uh um great,on releases during the quarter and continued our discussions you know things have really shown great resilience and so our,

um,um so one thing we are not talking about is um the risk going forward of reinfection and you know certainly,and so one thing we are not talking about is the risk going forward of reinfection and down rich i,
um,reversal of you know elective surgery uh shutdowns and whatnot um can you can you discuss that a little bit about,a lot of money on the elective uh procedure side and surgery than when that was shut down and then,
um,know it s it s a long road here and um you know maybe the toughest time ahead of us the,be glib about the optimism because it s a long road here and maybe the toughest time ahead of us,
um,houston went through it and you re seeing different places um and and the good news is they they seem to,and so you know you re seeing it as you said in hotspots you know houston they seem to be,
um,bit of that we do have to brace for that um in terms of hotspots i don t think it s,little bit of that we do have to brace for that in terms of hotspots i don t think it,
um,you know be quelled you know and and contained but um i i think it s very encouraging what we re,and i hope that continues to be quelled and contained but i think it s very encouraging what we re,
um,companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible um so i don t think there s a big hesitation,companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible so i don t think there s a big hesitation,
um,and and we think that will be the case okay um my second question uh and last question is what what,and we think that will be the case okay my second question and last question is what is your perspective,
um,what what is your perspective of how the hospital industry um looks like after this is all done i mean would,is what is your perspective of how the hospital industry looks like after this is all done i mean would,
um,se but the hospital business is weakened by all this um in the sense that you know we kind of went,hospital business not the medical office business per se but in the sense that you know we kind of went,
um,if if you think sort of picking your your your um your relationships becomes even more important in the aftermath because,eventually i m just wondering if you think sort of picking your relationships becomes even more important industry overall is,
um,markets i do think the strength and and scale matters um larger systems versus small independent system obviously you know more,next door i think there s one where the hospital is not a tenant but all the others are a,
um,questioning a little bit but i still think those strong um you know population growth centers are gonna be where you,s question a little bit differently i think at the g a rate you mentioned 150 million of acquisitions you,
um,hit and were helped a lot by the cares act um and cms in general but i do think we are,hit and were helped a lot by the cares act and cms in general but i do think we re,
um,and off campus it s a continuum and i think um you know all those innovations will continue and uh it,you re on and off campus it s a continuum and i think all those innovations will continue and it,
um,and related to that response thanks todd that was great um do you think the long awaited monetization of hospital and,and as related to that response thanks todd that was great do you think the long awaited monetization of hospital,
um,it s just we gotta keep the hope alive right um we just haven t seen it is the real answer,just we ve got to keep the hope alive right we just haven t seen it is the real answer,
um,we just haven t seen it is the real answer um it has all the makings to suggest that would be,we just haven t seen it is the real answer contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we,
um,all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true um we have a very contradicting data point here with the,the hope alive right we just haven t seen it is the real answer contradicting data point here with the,
um,chen with bmo capital please go ahead thanks good morning um todd in your opening remarks um you know you mentioned,great thanks thanks rich with bmo capital please go ahead thanks good morning todd in your opening remarks you mentioned,

um,piece of the pie each you know quarter or year um so you you do help that you do have a,what chris always walks through is each quarter or a year so you do help that we do have a,
um,no we re not adding a lot of free rent um you know we really don t have much if any,say generally no we re not adding a lot of free rent we really don t have much of any,
um,all it it typically is inside of of new leasing um and so when you have that uh with the new,doing it at all it typically is inside of new leasing and so when you have that with the new,
um,you see the the the revenue impact from that absorption um but uh but overall no we ve we ve not,little bit of a delay before you see the revenue impact from that absorption but overall no we ve not,
um,uh but overall no we ve we ve not seen um a marked expansion of of free rent okay and then,impact from that absorption but overall no we ve not seen a marked expansion of free rent okay and then,
um,i ll ask nick joseph s question a little differently um i think you mentioned 150 million of acquisitions you had,question a little bit differently i think at the g a rate you mentioned 150 million of acquisitions you had,

um,those health systems at all tenants in the buildings required um they have i would say that there are have certainly,rates in those buildings are in a similar range to what we have under contract and pipeline and certainly it,
um,certainly have physicians that are you know utilizing the hospital um next door um i think there s one where the,by year end hospital next door i think there s one where the hospital is not a tenant but all,

um,you know right now we are are running significantly below um where we are on a on a trailing 12 month,i talked about you know right now we are running significantly below where we are on a trailing 12 month,
um,are on a on a trailing 12 month basis but um you know we do think that that can pick up,significantly below where we are on a trailing 12 month basis but we do think that that can pick up,
um,spirit of seeing maybe some dividend growth at some point um but maybe it doesn t shake out that low okay,spirit of seeing maybe some dividend growth at some point but maybe it doesn t shake out that low okay,
um,all speculation obviously tayo but it s it s interesting um you know i think we saw the most extreme thing,of us you know with kids and it s going to be tough you know as soon as they shut,
um,i think you re gonna see a more targeted approach um rather than the sort of absolute you know month long,i do think you re gonna see a little bit of that we do have to brace for that in,
um,should therefore it shouldn t be quite as financially difficult um you know is it gonna be tough yeah just like,therefore it shouldn t be quite as financially difficult you know is it going to be tough yeah just like,
um,not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus mobs um we ll watch that just like everybody but i think,not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus mobs we ll watch that just like everybody but i think,
um,inaudible helping in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff um you you know look uh i think jorge said it,in helping in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff you know look i think jorge said it clearly in,
um,about how much of that is you know inventory rebuild um y you know it s hard to see exactly there,exceeding 19 your specific question about how much of that is inventory rebuild it s hard to see exactly there,
um,there s a couple things we re looking at and um you know uh that s that s one of the,s hard to see exactly there s a couple of things where looking at and that s one of the,
um,as a result there may be some bill back here um but look i i in my summary i was pretty,to stop building inventory on the daily stuff and as a result there i was pretty clear on saying hey,
um,from tycho peterson with jp morgan please go ahead hey um are you able to talk about how much of the,thank you person with dapy morgan just go ahead hey are you able to talk about how much of the,
um,it is uh you know it it s hard to um give a any precise number but as as don just,forward with distributors around potential additional de stocking it s hard to give any precise number but as don just,
um,network so uh there was an element of that and um when that comes back to uh to typical levels is,the next six months so you know there s a little bit of a lag there that we see at,
um,t think that is uh something that uh for us um is going to be uh meaningful from a long term,in the case of consumables there is a the order lead time is very short meaningful from a long term,
um,second quarter as as a result of lower revenues and um the uncertainty that we still have in in many places,experienced in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and the uncertainty that we still have in many,
um,if you know if there is risk of dissynergies here um and and how you think about that yeah thanks tycho,curious if there is risk of disinterviews here and how you think about that smile that we re keeping when,
um,and and how you think about that yeah thanks tycho um a we re we re actually there s a component,risk of disinterviews here and how you think about that smile that we re keeping when we say how we,
um,wire bending aspect of of suresmile that we re keeping um what uh when we say uh how we kinda delineate,here and how you think about that smile that we re keeping when we say how we kind of delineate,
um,s you know right now focused around our cerec base um y you know we kinda made that shift uh at,through a lot of different things you know the numbers we gave you represent you know the base case and,
um,do we really look at expanding in in places that um are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontia,do we really look at expanding in places that are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional orthodontic model,
um,more flexible in terms of financing uh or pricing potentially um you know it it s been interesting tycho w j,primescan and primemill potentially you know it s been interesting tycho even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning,
um,single unit crown in in you know an hour plus um so we we had made that shift and it was,i think is you know and you read all the books and you know after major disruptions and dislocations you,
um,and we ve been seeing a fair amount of success um with saying hey look i ve got to change how,talking to and we ve been seeing a fair amount of success with saying hey look i got to change,
um,barclays please go ahead hey thanks uh good morning everybody um a couple of quick questions for you you know first,beard please go ahead thank you good morning guys can you hear me okay i think it was on mute,
um,get your thoughts around that steve good morning jorge here um listen i it is it is early for us to,to go up pocket that s going to be reluctant at least in the u s to go back for,
um,is early for us to uh be able to extrapolate um from the july numbers uh and as uh as you,go ahead hey are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter was inventory,
um,challenging so and it is it is very hard to um make a judgment with respect to uh those numbers i,when you say digital i push digital pretty hard in my mind what i think whether it s the dsos,
um,quarters i think it s important thing to do so um uh har hard to tell you uh if if that,outcomes in the next few i think is the prudent thing to do so hard to tell you if that,
um,the decision tree on shutdown versus asset sale yeah steve um you know as we look at it right now we,s hard to see exactly there s a couple of things where looking at and that s one of the,
um,scenario and obviously we re gonna work to improve that um but but again uh the the process because uh you,base case and we re going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity to do,
um,questions i i wanna just dive back into the july um commentary specifically i apologize to keep harping on this but,our next question is from michael charney with bank of america i apologize to keep harvey on this but i,
um,geography perspective uh a as i as i indicated before um july definitely trended better than june um so uh that,clearly a faster clip yeah michael thanks for the question indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that,
um,i indicated before um july definitely trended better than june um so uh that that that is very good uh but,yeah michael thanks for the question indicated before july definitely trended better than june so that is very good but,
um,at this point i can t give you a breakdown um because uh there is some some analytics that we need,products at this point i can t give you a breakdown because there are some analytics that we still need,
um,analytics that we need we still need to do overall um the um the the total portfolio uh is is getting,analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to 19 numbers and in some instances it did better,
um,we need we still need to do overall um the um the the total portfolio uh is is getting closer to,t give you a breakdown because there are some analytics that we still need to do is getting closer to,
um,of it was tied historically to the integration you had um with omnicam and and with and with cerec and and,of it was tied historically to the integration you had with omnicam and with zurich and everything as you think,
um,michael i i would say that it s our system um look between omni and primescan uh you know we think,michael i would say that it s our system a pretty good installed base we have a very loyal user,
um,we feel it s uh uh really really competitive and um you know we re very comfortable with the clinical results,we came out with sure and you know we re very comfortable with the clinical results we re seeing and,
um,installed base we feel very good about that right now um a and look every single day uh we get better,installed base we feel very good about that right now serona not as individual product companies where we re sitting,
um,comment thank you and our next question is from jason um bednar with piper sandler please go ahead good morning uh,and our next question is from jason and bednar with piper sunder please go ahead and what we re seeing,
um,that doesn t have that same cerec owner base yeah um look we w we re happy to take suresmile into,a result there i was pretty clear on saying hey look we re happy that we saw consecutive month to,
um,both the orthodontics orthodontic as well as the gp channel um we think we ve got more innate advantages in the,in the area of orthodontics we believe that the clear liner space is unique strategic advantages including our large syracuse,
um,not to discuss new products before they re officially launched um but instead of talking specifically to the recently approved large,not to discuss new products before they re officially launched but instead of talking specifically to the recently approved large,
um,opportunity or a demand perspective for each of those categories um each of large field of view and also in office,an opportunity or demand perspective for each of those categories each of large field of view and also in office,
um,i i we re filling a gap in our portfolio um that you you know we w it took us a,wide field of view we re filling a gap in our portfolio that you know we it took us a,
um,do better endo it lets you do better orthodontia so um you know we we think the demand you know is,implants it lets you do better endo it lets you do better orthodontist so we think that demand you know,
um,know look our our one of the challenges in in um in this space uh you know versus other med device,printing we haven t really discussed that and look one of the challenges in this space versus other med device,
um,anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys um i just was wondering if we if you could help,is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys this was wondering if you could help,
um,us put some numbers around uh the new ortho strategy um can you talk about um the vol y you know,us put some numbers around the new ortho strategy maybe some comments about how you sell volumes trend within orthodontics,
um,uh the new ortho strategy um can you talk about um the vol y you know maybe some comments about how,was wondering if you could help us put some numbers around the new ortho strategy maybe some comments about how,
um,on a go forward basis thank you yeah thanks elizabeth um you know it s funny we we we haven t,framing that opportunity on a go forward basis thank you yeah thanks elizabeth you know it s and we want,
um,of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision um uh look we we feel that uh dentsply sirona has,to get there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we ve,
um,in the space and we re gonna work toward that um so you you know can do some math around that,know the base case and we re going to work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity,
um,then you know given obviously you guys have a pretty um substantial liquidity position right now how do you see that,then you know given obviously you guys have a pretty substantial liquidity position right now how do you see that,
um,uh yeah good morning listen our our capital deployment philosophies um a are not changing have not changed i think uh,assume that you know yeah good morning listen our capital deployment philosophies are not changing have not changed i think,
um,we totally agree with at this point we want to um keep uh doing what we re doing being very fluent,we totally agree with at this point we want to keep doing what we re doing and being very prudent,
um,operating cash flow got very good free cash flow and um all our parts of our deployment uh will you know,operating cash flow if the focus is on the recovery is how to ensure that we have a very stable,
um,are not changing for now we paid paid our dividends um and we have no plans to change our dividend at,re not changing ever again so i ve been trying to condition the organization to understand that this is a,
um,a follow up on strategy after that yeah thanks steve um you know conditions in germany are are uh if if,control and then i have a follow up on strategy after that yeah thanks steve conditions in germany are if,
um,you were gonna go around the world are pretty good um y you know a and again i think jorge said,you were going to go around the world staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes it s,
um,on that future strategic uh vision thank you thanks steve um y you know i i i think what covid has,the last few months and how your thinking has evolved on that future strategic vision thank you what covid has,
um,it gets there in two years three years five years um i i think it s gonna accelerate a a couple,whether it gets there in two years three years five years i think it s going to accelerate a couple,
um,address that accordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize um you know our training and and whatnot so you know,i m going to address that accordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize our training and whatnot i don,
um,pandemic has kind of altered the the thinking around them um y y you know john uh first thanks for the,pushing harder i think the pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you know look when you when challenges in the,
um,know we kinda said it was a three year program um i i would say that uh and particularly with the,and we kind of said it was a three year program i would say that and particularly with the announcements,
um,think the uh pandemic has accelerated our our thinking and um y you know uh look when you when you see,think the pandemic has accelerated our thinking and you know look when you when challenges in the second quarter it,
um,so that s kind of what i would tell you um uh i i w it it s really interesting internally,need to get after even faster so that s kind of what i would tell you is really interesting internally,
um,out we re we re uh more than halfway done um but i would also tell you uh b uh you,of where we thought we would be i would just tell you that our management team committed to as soon,
um,you know we ve been happy with our implant business um i i would tell you uh y you know when,and are you rethinking we ve been happy with our implant business i would tell you when you say the,
um,uh y you know across the whole portfolio was challenging um w as we talk and think rethink about our portfolio,relative but versus prior year across the whole portfolio it was challenging as we talk and rethink about our portfolio,
um,get our new products where we need to get them um you know ob obviously we ve talked about our immediate,rethink about our portfolio we think we ve started to actually get our obviously we ve talked about our immediate,

um,is trevor on for jon thanks for taking my questions um so you i think you mentioned earlier that your patient,is trevor rohn for john thanks for taking my questions i m wondering if there s any detail you can,
um,through to you know potentially some of your july comments um you know through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor,through to potentially some of your july comments through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor trevor a couple things,
um,you know through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor um a couple things i i mean first we re we,your july comments through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor trevor a couple things i mean first we re,
um,infection protocols so we see that group as pretty positive um one one of the things we were trying to watch,addressing infection protocols so we see that group as pretty positive one of the things we were trying to watch,
um,know there s a little bit of a lag there um that that we see uh particularly in the us but,know there s a little bit of a lag there that we see at elsewhere around the world so patient,
um,indicator and and a again we re we re seeing um we re seeing some good positive things there yeah thank,tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and again we re seeing some good positive things there yeah thank,
um,what you ve been seeing and if you think that um you know some of the smaller uh more fragmented practitioners,what you ve been seeing and if you think that some of the smaller more fragmented practitioners could start to,
um,practitioners could start to play catch up there as well um we to to be honest trevor we haven t seen,smaller more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up as well to be honest trevor we haven t seen,
um,know there s 600 000 dentists ar around the world um and uh and they re independent business owners and they,know there s a little bit of a lag there that we see at elsewhere around the world so patient,

um,dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory um condition what it means practically for the company is that,company was founded many years ago to our knowledge no company has ever therapeutically addressed for the company is that,
um,tear fluid of patients that have been administered uh reproxalap um and all of that leads us to believe that we,tear fluid of patients that have been administered raproxilab position to file an nda for dry disease next year as,
um,results uh from the preliminary outputs that we have here um enrollment hasn t started the ind has been filed for,positive results from the preliminary outputs that we have here enrollment hasn t started the ind has been filed for,

um,the subject of uh further um uh in vivo investigation um uh in covid that is being performed uh by niaid,ind has been filed for 629 as i mentioned on the call today covid that is being performed by niad,
um,niaid and we re absolutely thrilled about niaid decision to um to test uh adx 1612 on our behalf um the,by niad and we re absolutely thrilled about niad s decision to test adx 16 12 on our behalf the,
um,to um to test uh adx 1612 on our behalf um the covid impact as you mentioned louise across the industry,s decision to test adx 16 12 on our behalf the covid impact as you mentioned louise across the industry,
um,what seemed to have happened during uh the peak of um uh covid cases uh back in march april may and,trial in our case in our pipeline happened during the peak of covid cases back in march april may and,
um,many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite um uh vision changes despite uh losing sight uh the um,many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite vision changes despite number of patients coming in was diminished,

um,with regard to our other uh clinical programs we ve um uh relative to the impact of of covid okay thank,initiate again in the fall regard to our other clinical program believe relative to the active of covid okay thank,
um,thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress um i know it s early days but you know as,thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress i know it s early days but you know as,
um,uh disease perspective and labeling perspective great good morning justin um and good to hear from you the as i highlighted,disease perspective they want perspective right good morning justin and good to hear from you the as i highlighted in,
um,ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques um we will end up validating the precise technique and and,a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure rats rats exist in our body in two forms,
um,the rasp studies to begin shortly okay great got it um and maybe then you know how do you think about,the ras studies to begin shortly okay great got it and maybe then you know how do you think about,
um,clinical community perceive uh duration of dosing and dosing regimen um first of all i think that uh signs of diseases,might the clinical community perceive duration of dosing and dosing regimens first of all i think that signs of diseases,
um,i think most patients and physicians view signs as regulatory um uh milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely,i think that signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily first and foremost regulatory milestones you re thinking,
um,purely with signs i think is a lot less important um in this case for one to two doses uh day,for the rast trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to 28 days on the,
um,uh for the maintenance phase okay that s really helpful um maybe just a clarification question i i know in the,bid dosing for the maintenance phase okay that s really helpful maybe just a clarification question i know in the,
um,there s uh gonna be a dry eye nda filing um by the end of next year is the current thinking,to be a dry nda filing by the end of next year is the current thinking still to continue on,
um,for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap um the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing,that the timelines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap the efficacy studies the timeline for filing,
um,strategy but of course we ll have to see how um events play out um uh over the latter part of,best regulatory strategy but of course we ll have to see how events play out over the latter part of,
um,we ll have to see how um events play out um uh over the latter part of this year and the,of course we ll have to see how events play out over the latter part of this year in the,
um,as well right great that makes a lot of sense um my last question is just uh you know on the,but also to patients as well right that makes a lot of sense my last question is just on the,
um,you would anticipate for it right for dry eye disease um my current understanding is that the fda generally requires 100,into more detail on the significant the fda s recognition of rast as a sign for dry eye disease is,
um,requires 100 patients complete one year of dosing uh however um uh based on um other res other sponsors interactions with,a lot of sense my last question is just on the safety study however based on other sponsors interactions with,
um,one year of dosing uh however um uh based on um other res other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe,my last question is just on the safety study however based on other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe,
um,patients uh such that uh they have 100 completers at um at 12 months uh and to our knowledge the uh,patients such that they have 100 completers at 12 months and to our knowledge the safety trials are fairly standard,
um,to our knowledge the uh uh the safety trials are um are fairly standard in in dry eye disease um i,100 completers at 12 months and to our knowledge the safety trials are fairly standard in dry eye disease i,
um,are um are fairly standard in in dry eye disease um i will say as i mentioned in my uh prepared,knowledge the safety trials are fairly standard in dry eye disease i will say as i mentioned in my prepared,
um,your question hi morning everyone hope you re doing well um i guess on the the 2021 color that you gave,you know going to go down or i mean i guess we ll get another the way is that you,
um,that actually how you re thinking about the 2021 plan um as we said here today uh yes laugh a little,add value to our shareholders as we sit here today okay good and then obviously you made a comment on,
um,today uh yes laugh a little bit of both brad um you know it does depend on where commodity prices head,now that you ve been slowing a bit is that that too you know going to go down or i,
um,year whether we wanna pick up a rig or not um i think we ve been pretty vocal or consistent about,matter where we are in the cycle so i think we re just going to see more and more opportunities,
um,oil to wanna go back to spending large capital dollars um but outside of that uh at some point end of,environment we re not spending any drilling capital these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat about sort of,
um,of this year early next year completing those wells will um allow us to main production flat year over year okay,no further drilling or completion activity this year we can maintain approximately flat year over year production in 2020 compared,
um,to main production flat year over year okay got it um and then obviously you made the comment on m a,as we sit here today okay good and then obviously you made a comment on m a can you go,
um,any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them um the opportunities are increasing um and size is variable from,any thoughts you have about an ability to fund them the opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small,
um,an ability to fund them um the opportunities are increasing um and size is variable from small to quite large as,about an ability to fund them the opportunities are increasing and size is variable from small to quite large as,
um,companies i think all of this will result in further um opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets um it,bankrupt companies i think all of this will result in further opportunities in terms of larger company selling assets it,
um,further um opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets um it it is difficult with no public equity and for,further opportunities in terms of larger company selling assets it is difficult with no public equity and for that matter,
um,we re gonna maintain a very healthy leverage amount and um keep ourselves from getting into distress no matter where we,of those few but we ve had discussions with financial parties who are to a distress no matter where we,
um,truist securities please proceed with your question morning all robert um first question on the also on that same line on,truist securities with your question good morning all robert first question also on that same line on 21 expectations that,
um,about maintenance capex you know given just so low because um you know if i recall i thought frank already had,think about maintenance capex given just so low because if i recall i thought frank already had you what else,
um,yes there s no country club memberships uh up here um you know e e the the the 11 wells we,if he wants to you know we keep things pretty simple at the end of the day we feel like,
um,flat at 30 million now is that sustainable absolutely not um you know we still have a relatively high decline rate,that same line on 21 expectations that i m just wondering you know why i realize this plan really i,
um,online if we waited till the very end of 21 um we re gonna have a hard time keeping production relatively,any and if we didn t spend any capital then you can kind of forecast what our blow down production,
um,re gonna have a hard time keeping production relatively flat um i if we brought them on today you know we,any drilling capital these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat about sort of pdp decline you know on,
um,get all this flush production from these new wells so um you know maintenance uh eh to maintain you know 13,this plan really i think you know at least the ones you just initial laid out it seems no new,
um,40 environment and we re not spending any drilling capital um these 11 ducts will help us keep production flat okay,at low 40 environment we re not spending any drilling capital these 11 ducks will help us keep production flat,
um,capital then you can kind of forecast what our blowdown um production would look like uh even if we didn t,any capital then you can kind of forecast what our blow down production would look like even if we didn,
um,northland capital markets please proceed with your question hi guys um i was wondering uh robert or or maybe mark how,northland capital markets please proceed with your question it could help you know if the returns were good and it,
um,you staying free cashflow positive in the context of evaluating um you know whether to go after the the ducts and,re just going to be free cash will positive this year and next year kind of irrespective of anything else,
um,time would you view that as as kind of a um you know a a must if you will or would,get another the way is that you know you re able to give us kind of how many wells would,
um,is to make good individual decisions at the well head um a and that s why we were quick to to,is to make good individual decisions of the well head and that s why we were quick to put the,
um,nice uh rrs for the incremental cost to complete them um i i in terms of are we so focused on,and have pretty nice irrs for the incremental cost to complete them in terms of are we so focused on,
um,prices if all we re doing is completing the ducts um a at some point you know we we do anticipate,with prices if all we re doing is completing the docs there s a bit of obviously a lag there,
um,year we re not free cashflow positive no not necessarily um but we re not so fixated on checking that box,year we re not free catchable positive no not necessarily but we re not so fixated on checking that box,
um,uh and having some outspend for some period of time um yeah we still think is supported by the economics uh,re going to be cash flow negative for a period of time i think longer term over a year time,
um,we can of of the individual decisions we re making um at the well heads yeah the only i ll add,of the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions of the well head and that,
um,price is sure understood appreciate those comments my follow up um i think i still have um you know a a,price is sure understood appreciate those comments that s my follow up and you guys still have a decent amount,
um,comments my follow up um i think i still have um you know a a decent amount of of non op,comments that s my follow up and you guys still have a decent amount of non off exposure in the,
um,any activity levels there and more on the land side um is there any traction or conversations uh on swapping any,of non off exposure in the permian are you guys seeing any activity levels there and conversations on swapping any,
um,quite some time now since you know at least march um and so nothing s moving very quickly there uh we,for quite some time now since you know at least march and so nothing s moving very quickly there we,
um,in getting it done in the spring but you know um back in back then it looked like things would be,and getting it done in the spring but you know back then it looked like things would be pretty dire,
um,uh the fall redetermination could could look like sh sure um probably too early to you know inaudible anything around numbers,head into the fall redetermination you know back in march you know we re early and getting it done in,
um,we we do that normal course irrespective of the environment um y you know the the one thing i d say,concerning in that regard now i will say like does the environment feel better now than it did three months,
um,re not drilling and completing new wells inaudible roll off um you know fortunately you know we we feel like we,you ll have on the free cash and completing new wells and hedges roll off fortunately we feel like we,
um,realizations for for the month of of april and may um a at the end of the day it s still,teeing realizations for the months of april and may i think at the end of the day it s still,
um,environment for for for companies in general and the banks um maybe they feel a little better because we re at,environment for companies in general maybe they feel a little better because we re at 45 or 42 versus somewhere,
um,lot of trepidation on the bank s part in general um and yeah i don t frankly see them letting up,is a lot of trepidation in the bank s part in general and i don t frankly no that being,
um,now now that being said that s a general statement um you know we ve got one time leverage and liquidity,no that being said that s a general statement we ve got one time leverage in liquidity and generally are,
um,like we ve got a pretty supportive bank group that um is gonna be reasonable and fair and and historically that,like we ve got enough ability to pay down debt to outpace that decrease and really we don t see,
um,and fair and and historically that s been the case um but too early to to to circle a number thanks,than 14 that s not the run rate by the way it s not 14 million a quarter that was,
um,too early to to to circle a number thanks mark um and then i guess just from a follow up you,for the months of april and may i think at the end of the day it s still not a,
um,did some uh pretty creative things to get loe down um in the second quarter i know you you talked about,so some of these things we did in the second quarter are sustainable and we ll continue doing the right,
um,a more historical range but you know any of those um initiatives that you took that you think that you could,know a more historical range but you know any of those initiatives that you took do you think that you,
um,took that you think that you could can carry forward um to kinda help mitigate that uh loe curve uh definitely,that you took do you think that you can carry forward to kind of help mitigate that total decrease definitely,
um,in some cases rod pump in other cases plunger lift um what have you so um we re continuing to work,methods in some cases rod pump in other cases plunger lift what have you so we re continuing to work,
um,in other cases plunger lift um what have you so um we re continuing to work through that and that will,in other cases plunger lift what have you so we re continuing to work through that and that will definitely,
um,proceed with your question hey good morning hi noel i um uh y you know i was thinking about uh having,parks with kokor and palmer please proceed with your question hey good morning you know i was thinking about having,
um,you know that s uh uh not a really great um flexibility you have there and and i mean was that,so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we re at low,
um,and and i mean was that just sort of a um a result of the the timing of everything you know,to work through that and that will definitely help reduce loe and then some of the things that you know,
um,the rails with covid and opec russia or or was um w was that uh sort of part of the plan,expend to drill in the complete wells versus the cash flow does that mean over the course of the year,
um,flat for three years running with various amounts of capital um if you go back and think about the beginning of,production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital if you go back and think about the beginning,
um,know related to the fourth quarter earnings and full year um we had a one rig program we were gonna average,know related to the fourth quarter earnings in full year we had a one rig program we were going to,
um,for the entire year a tiny bit of free cashflow um and those 11 wells would ve been completed uh i,for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow and those 11 wells would have been completed i,
um,know i can t remember but pretty darn close so um i d say it s a fallout of what s,now i can t remember but pretty darn close so it s a fallout of what s happened here and,
um,nicely through it and come out the other side and um can continue to uh find ways to consolidate and grow,at least this recent piece of it that we you know and continue to find ways to consolidate and grow,
um,you touched on this earlier and i i missed it um for the free cashflow calculation if i looked at the,you touched on this earlier and i missed it for the free cash flow calculation if i looked at the,
um,capex incurred in the quarter and i was just wondering um for the the free cashflow calculation going forward um just,is one incurred in the quarter and i was just wondering for the free cash flow calculation going forward and,
um,wondering um for the the free cashflow calculation going forward um just kind of which which which one of those is,for the free cash flow calculation going forward and there s just kind of which one of those is more,
um,is more important then for us to use as we um you know just just try to model that we always,more important for us to use as we you know just try to model that we always use accrued cash,
um,or something like that okay so so real oh and um one other thing i um and i i just don,140 million depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that so you know this is just a,
um,so so real oh and um one other thing i um and i i just don t have the release in,outspend no we re not and from a practical matter and we re just going to be free cash will,
um,you th that s something all of you re routinely um include well include the im impact of in the free,accrued cash from a calculation standpoint because not all the bills necessarily include well include the impact in a free,
um,do versus if you re using a cash capex number um you know the the second quarter was very atypical from,expenditures for activity here in that period in a cash cap ex number the second quarter was very atypical from,
um,of of free cashflow yeah our debt balance went up um and the the reason for that is because and of,free cash flow yeah our debt balance went up and the reason for that is because and of course this,
um,when you get the bills and when you pay them um so very atypical quarter yeah a as we mentioned in,when you get the bills and when you pay them so very typical quarter yeah as we mentioned the press,
um,july we we paid down a little more than 14 um that s not the the run right by the way,july we pay down a little more than 14 that s not the run rate by the way it s,
um,that was high because of timing but we do expect um i mean really every month this year that we re,quarter that was high because of timing but we do expect i mean really every month this year that were,
um,month this year that we re paying down some debt um without any big changes in the working capital status great,every month this year that were paying down some debt without any big changes in the working capital status great,
um,my questions and congratulations on all progress in the quarter um just three from me today um firstly could you just,all right thanks stephen on all the progress in the quarter just three for me today firstly could you just,
um,progress in the quarter um just three from me today um firstly could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for,the progress in the quarter just three for me today firstly could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for,
um,elaborate on the market opportunity for the zimmer s deal um i think it was about seven billion procedures how many,elaborate on the market opportunity for the zimmid deal i think about 7 million procedures how many of those procedures,
um,orders or seeing use of the product and then lastly um sorry i m i m going to ask the question,quarter placing orders or seeing use of the product and then lastly sorry i m going to ask the question,
um,us down the line but with the recent opioid approval um does this change your thinking on zalviso or what can,just down the line so with the recent opioid approval does this change your thinking on the visa or what,
um,those questions the first one is the zimmer biomet opportunity um just in general we said about seven and a half,three for me today firstly could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for the zimmid deal i think about,
um,extractions otherwise known as wisdom teeth extractions uh dental implants um you know bone grafting there there s a number of,third molar extractions otherwise known as wisdom teeth extractions dental implants you know bone grafting there s a number of,
um,use iv opioids and we re really looking to replace um iv opioids in that market br brandon so so answering,dentists that use iv opioids and we re really looking to replace iv opioids in that market brandon so answering,
um,country su sure uh dsuvia is being used uh in um ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in procedural suites,specialist around the country sure dysuvia is being used in ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in procedural suites,
um,ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in procedural suites um adjacent to per physicians offices it s being used in,ambulatory surgery settings it s being used in procedural suites adjacent physician s offices it s being used in emergency,
um,rooms so we re seeing a lot of dsuvia use um in short term settings also in uh some interesting medically,in emergency rooms so we re seeing a lot of disuvia use in short term settings also some interesting medically,
um,seeing oral surgery typically as well as in ent procedures um so again medically supervised settings covers a wide swath of,seeing oral surgery typically as well as some ent procedures so again medically supervised settings covers a wide swath of,
um,if i sneak one more and i apologize you just um triggered something else um just in terms of the feedback,if i sneak one more i apologize you just triggered something else just in terms of the feedback you received,
um,more and i apologize you just um triggered something else um just in terms of the feedback you ve received from,more i apologize you just triggered something else just in terms of the feedback you received from physicians using the,
um,feedback you ve received from uh physicians using the product um is the onset of action and duration of effects being,feedback you received from physicians using the product is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in,
um,that s it from me how promise thank you absolutely um the the onset of action is very consistent um again,that consistently so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent and the duration of action is interesting actually,
um,absolutely um the the onset of action is very consistent um again the sublingual route of administration avoids the first pass,trials and i m back there for me i promise again the sublingual route of administration avoids the first path,
um,opioid medications don t really work quickly or that consistently um so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent,opioid medications don t really work quickly or that consistently so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent,
um,action is interesting it s actually a little bit longer um than uh you know our clinical trial we did not,consistent and the duration of action is interesting actually a little bit longer than our clinical trial we did not,
um,trial we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia um we are going up against placebo you try to keep,trial we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia when you re going up against placebo you try to,
um,yeah i think the general feedback beyond what pam said um is that it s actually delivering on the messages we,submissions i think the good news in that approval is that they re clearly seeing and recognize the importance of,
um,you know i mean the in the pack using importance um time to discharge is sort of a composite measure uh,you know i know that they do use various drugs in the office but just add in another one and,
um,time as well as you know making sure inaudible safety um you re patients including your elderly patients don t have,well as you know making sure when i say safety your patients including your elderly patients don t have any,
um,hey guys thank you so much for taking my questions um a follow up on the zimmer biomet deal what feedback,helpful thank you very much thank you our next question today will come from michael higgins of leidenberg salmon please,
um,you gotten from dentists regarding using the product in office um are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the,siegerman of credit suisse please go ahead hey guys and are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the,
um,are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the um necessary infrastructure that they would have to have by having,are they comfortable storing it in kind of all the necessary infrastructure that they would have to have by having,
um,various drugs in the office but just adding another one um and then kind of you had mentioned business development any,various drugs in the office but just add in another one and then kind of you had mentioned business development,
um,development any thoughts as to what you re looking for um in terms of a target product profile or even more,development any thoughts as to what you re looking for in terms of a target product profile or even more,
um,it first was approved because they saw the obvious benefits um they we are only uh brand certifying and supplying it,it first was approved because they saw the obvious benefits a duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop,
um,them having to stop their procedure and redose their iv um opioids which they typically have to do multiple times throughout,having to stop their procedure and re dose their iv opioids which they typically have to do multiple times throughout,
um,why uh you know zimmer saw the benefit as well um they know these surgeries very well and they know the,to do multiple times throughout a procedure benefit as well they know these surgeries very well and they know the,
um,zimmer and and we mentioned that these other specialty markets um they re large markets but we don t have a,reiterate why go with zimmer and we mentioned these other specialty markets large markets but we don t have a,
um,a large enough salesforce to penetrate like these partners have um aa as well as the relationships um that that they,large enough sales force to penetrate like these partners as well as the relationships that they ve built up compared,
um,these partners have um aa as well as the relationships um that that they ve built up um compared to what,sales force to penetrate like these partners as well as the relationships that they ve built up compared to what,
um,as the relationships um that that they ve built up um compared to what we have so we want to focus,the relationships that they ve built up compared to what we have so we want to focus on the hospital,
um,want to focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets um with the partners uh that are already in these we,to focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets with the partners that are already in these we re calling,
um,moving forward so for us the biggest key is efficiency um meaning or the call patterns within these medically supervised settings,opportunities moving forward for us the biggest key is efficiency meaning always the call patterns within these medically supervised settings,
um,the actual uh therapeutic area is less relevant for us um it s more of where they are located for use,cetera we want to continue to target those the actual therapeutic area is less relevant for us account overlap is,
um,of where they are located for use of these products um account overlap is critical and will be opportunistic on a,those the actual therapeutic area is less relevant for us account overlap is critical and will be opportunistic on a,
um,expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid 2021 um we are also looking at options to enhance afm13 s,expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid 2021 therapy the first of these options is the combination with,
um,also a third cohort or there is a third cohort um in this study for patients with transformed mycosis fungoides so,also a third cohort or there is a third cohort in this study for patients with transformed mucosis fungoides so,
um,a dose dependent killing of this innate positive plasma cells um was observed we believe that we observed improved potency mediated,synomunkies disease whereas a dose dependent killing of bcma positive plasma cells was observed we believe that the improved potency,
um,turn the call back to adi adi thank you angus um as you can see from our presentation uh today uh,turn the call over to adi adi thank you alex financial results while we re still in the middle of,
um,system is something that if you need to establish that um affimed and is uh helping us in guiding the design,euros or 17 cents per common share during the second quarter of 2019 helping us in guiding the design of,
um,ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression um progression we can bring in uh additional milestones and for,multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program progression we can bring in additional milestone and,
um,that we can have an an id filing first for um afm28 finally before we open the session for q and,so that we can have an ind filing first for afm 28 finally before we open the session for q,
um,on the progress and uh thanks for taking my questions um to start off just wondering for afm24 i m not,that s under progress and thanks for taking my questions to start off just wondering for afm24 i m not,
um,if both patients in cohort two have been dosed and um if you can talk more uh about the the timing,this but just wondering if both patients in have been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing,
um,parts of the questions i hope i got them all um so we face one study afm 24 um as we,parts to the questions i hope i got them all so the phase one study of afm 24 as we,
um,them all um so we face one study afm 24 um as we said we are uh recruiting in the second,i got them all so the phase one study of afm 24 as we said we are recruiting into second,
um,we said we are uh recruiting in the second cohort um we have not yet disclosed how many patients um but,we said we are recruiting into second cohort be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with,
um,cohort um we have not yet disclosed how many patients um but you know it s a standard uh three by,complete details on the exact milestone payments but you know phase two phase three things of that sort should we,
um,know it s a standard uh three by three design um with with a inaudible uh dose modification uh but what,and on ist and the end of the website now shows that the study is enrolling but the initiation is,
um,modification uh but what that s basically what it is um in terms of timing between the patients uh there is,been dosed and if you can talk more about the timing of dosing between patients and with the four sites,
um,patients got it okay great and then also for afm24 um just checking if you can say more about the tumor,rather got it okay that s the and then maybe just on cohort one for afm 24 and what we,
um,the checkpoint inhibitor and and combo plans at this point um so for the uh tumor types uh in the does,as checkpoint inhibitors such as pd 1 and pd 1 1 slide 8 and first let me comment on our,
um,uh we will enroll into uh tumor specific expansion cohorts um and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of,the dose escalation part would also be open for other egfr expressing tumors like for current in the process of,
um,of being defined now for our pd 1 combination plans um based on the interesting data we have seen with pd,process of being defined now for our pd 1 combination plans based on the interesting data we have seen with,
um,jim yeah hi guys and congrats on all the progress um maybe just a first quick question for angus uh to,jim hi guys that congrats on all the progress maybe just a first quick question for angus to start him,
um,of hours that we re that we re working on um the the various genentech programs um that are in progress,based primarily on the number of hours that we re working on the various genetic programs that are in progress,
um,we re working on um the the various genentech programs um that are in progress um i mean you can see,we re working on the various genetic programs that are in progress i mean you can see just looking back,
um,the the various genentech programs um that are in progress um i mean you can see just looking back at the,the various genetic programs that are in progress i mean you can see just looking back at the last several,
um,result of inaudible time milestone payments that we received so um you know this this milestone payment um that we discussed,a result of point in time milestone payments that we receive so you know this milestone payment that we discussed,
um,we received so um you know this this milestone payment um that we discussed today um that will that we ll,in time milestone payments that we receive so you know this milestone payment that we discussed today that we ll,
um,know this this milestone payment um that we discussed today um that will that we ll get in the third quarter,know this milestone payment that we discussed today that we ll get in the third quarter will likely increase our,
um,that will that we ll get in the third quarter um will will likely increase our revenue in a in the,payment that we discussed today that we ll get in the third quarter will likely increase our revenues in the,
um,okay okay that s helpful and then maybe just on um cohort one for afm24 and what we might learn from,okay that s the and then maybe just on cohort one for afm 24 and what we might learn from,
um,for afm24 and what we might learn from that cohort um can you remind us if you re doing pre and,for afm 24 and what we might learn from that cohort can you remind us if you re doing pre,
um,how that might inform you know the ability to recruit um innate cells to the tumor site yeah um so in,you know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so,
um,to recruit um innate cells to the tumor site yeah um so in the uh dose escalation part um we do,know the ability to recruit innate cells to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do,
um,site yeah um so in the uh dose escalation part um we do a pre treatment biopsy uh post or on,to the tumor site yeah so in the dose escalation part we do a pre treatment biopsy post or on,
um,uh peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as um a cytokine profiles uh once we are in the expansion,looking at peripheral activation markers of nk cells as well as on cytokine profiles once we are in the expansion,
um,comments on the variability in peripheral nk cell uh populations um is there any sense in screening patients for their nk,given the comments on the variability in peripheral nk cell populations is there any sense in screening patients for their,
um,any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels um given that you know patients who screen low may not,any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels given that patients who screen low may not have adequate,
um,do you feel like within the variability of innate cell um in the blood that that you ll be able to,you feel like within the variability of an eight cell in the blood that you ll be able to have,
um,to do that and maybe just a final question just um the md anderson collaboration is focused on core blood derived,do that and maybe just a final question and just the andy anderson collaboration is focused on core blood derived,
um,the md anderson collaboration is focused on core blood derived um nk cells is there any thought to other nk cell,the andy anderson collaboration is focused on core blood derived nk cells is there any thought to other nk cell,
um,is there any thought to other nk cell sources including um potentially ipfc nk cells um adi you want to take,cells is there any thought to other nk cell sources including potentially ipsc derived nk cells you want to take,
um,other nk cell sources including um potentially ipfc nk cells um adi you want to take this question or should i,to other nk cell sources including potentially ipsc derived nk cells you want to take this question or should i,
um,and if you uh watch the field of nk cell um based approached especially the the the field around companies and,of nk cells and if you watch the field of nk cell based approaches of nk cells there is definitely,
um,approached especially the the the field around companies and institutes um providing different sources of nk cells there is definitely uh,nk cells and if you watch the field of nk cell based approaches of nk cells there is definitely speed,
um,we have also received uh proactive inquiries of uh potential um working models to gather so we are looking at the,we have also received proactive inquiries of potential working models together and so we see this cobalt derived in case,
um,guys may maybe as a brief comment we see this um core blood derived nk cells already quite advanced and chemically,of potential working models together and so we see this cobalt derived in case those already quite advanced in clinical,
um,have already been uh many patients well with ipsc currently um there is still a um the inaudible to be determined,there have already been many patients treated while with the ipses currently there is still the safety to be determined,
um,patients well with ipsc currently um there is still a um the inaudible to be determined and uh obviously in combination,many patients treated while with the ipses currently there is still the safety to be determined and obviously in combination,
um,for unk uh just a couple regarding the bcma engager um i understand that you probably linked to this ability on,is e k allen for doe kim just a couple regarding the bcma and the engager i understand that you,
um,in terms of could they potentially pursue an accelerated pathway um for the assets and secondly uh again you re you,planned maybe in terms of could it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway for the assets and secondly again you don,
um,what the future milestones uh for the asset might hold um in terms of uh you know phase two phase three,secondly again you don t provide complete details on the exact milestone payments but you know phase two phase three,
um,share with you i think you re aware of course um licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal,share with you i think you re aware of course licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal,
um,you know the inco the first incomers in the space um i would think say that genentech shares our excitement with,licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal we did with genentech they re obviously excited about the,
um,think it s it s a it s a clearly um uh strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule,maybe i leave it there i think it s a clearly strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule,
um,what you would expect for the early nature of the um license uh agreement uh beyond that we aren t able,would expect for the early nature of the license agreement on that we re not able to disclose any further,
um,of course will be looked at carefully in patients that um we should not expect any kind of uh cytokine release,us to the conclusion which of course will be looked at carefully in patients that any kind of cytokine release,
um,when we will have the optimal uh biologically active dose um as there are a number of of co variants like,possible to predict when we will have the optimal biologically active dose as there are a number of covariance like,
um,sites for cd16 binding sites for egfr and then distribution um and as you know the the animal models especially in,sites for cd16 binding sites for egfr and then distribution and as you know the animal models especially enformer co,
um,terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very difficult to translate um the relevant tox species and you have to inaudible that,co dynamics are very difficult to translate the relevant talk species and we have thought that that s only a,
um,as adi said something that we are actively looking into um we ll starting out with uh lymphomas obviously with afm13,is as adi said something that we are actively looking into we re starting also for afm 24 we will,
um,this time for closing remarks we go to our speakers um yes thank you again for uh listening in and uh,of this time for any closing remarks please go ahead speakers yeah thank you again for listening in and following,
um,for uh listening in and uh following our our updates um the the uh the progress is uh coming smoothly along,go ahead speakers yeah thank you again for listening in and following our updates the program is coming smoothly along,
um,you very much yeah thanks for your question i mean um yes the negative price rule applies to uh the uk,thank you very much yeah thanks for your question i mean yes the negative price rule applies to the uk,
um,yes the negative price rule applies to uh the uk um and we have a similar one but the technical details,the negative price rule applies to the uk and we have a similar one but the technical details are slightly,
um,i don t know the exact details and so far um i think um i mean you can you can usually,have to admit i don t know the exact details and so far i think i mean you can usually,
um,know the exact details and so far um i think um i mean you can you can usually plan it because,know the exact details and so far i think i mean you can usually plan it because you know your,
um,us it s uh it s a minor techna technicality um on and if you want the details i think please,going forward but the team will come back on the technicalities thanks a lot thank you wanda next question please,
um,understand where the drum measured inaudible from the uk one um on the targets i mean we already g gave you,can go the one way or the other i mean it s too early i mean we are open to,
um,our targets but i mean our targets have been communicated um in a couple of months ago so don t expect,thanks a lot i mean i would appreciate if you could get back to me on the details on the,
um,uh the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean um but as the team comes back but i think i,the the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean but the team comes back but i think for us,
um,overrated issue also going forward because what we see is um we get more and more flexibility in the system in,an overrated issue also going forward because what we see is we get more and more flexibility in the system,
um,the market overall because incentivizes investments in flexibilities like batteries um and that these if you ll get more of that,the market overall because it incentivizes it will definitely take at first the negative power prices away so we don,
um,go ahead yes good morning good afternoon uh quick one um could you provide us a bit more color on the,please go ahead yes good morning good afternoon quick one could you provide us a bit more colour on the,
um,footprint in uh in the french uh onshore uh market um so we understand the strategy behind it it would be,print in the french onshore market so we understand the strategy behind it would be great if we could get,
um,level uh while the big projects which are in there um and uh basically what is the expected time for contribution,level a lot of big projects which are in there and basically what is the expected time for contribution there,
um,would be the question one and bouncing back on this um what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets uh,expected time for contribution there one and bouncing back on this what is your view regarding acquisition of renewable assets,
um,you see that like value accretive and uh would you um in such a situation consider uh potentially even sounding uh,you see that like value are creative and would you in such a situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions,
um,situation consider uh potentially even sounding uh large acquisitions uh um by uh reconsidering your inaudible thank you very much yeah,situation consider potentially even founding larger acquisitions by reconsidering yours thank you neil thank you very much yeah thanks for,
um,by uh reconsidering your inaudible thank you very much yeah um thanks for your question let me start with the latter,reconsidering yours thank you neil thank you very much yeah thanks for your question let me start with the latter,
um,latter one i think for us i mean having a um a a deep pipeline uh where we can invest our,yeah thanks for your question let me start with the latter one a deep pipeline where we can invest our,
um,where we can invest our money it would not be um let s let s put it value optimal to actually,deep pipeline where we can invest our money it would not be let s put it value optimal to actually,
um,we want to build them we want to operate them um and us becoming a financial investor i mean i see,we want to build them we want to operate them and us becoming a financial investor i mean i see,
um,if you can maybe swap assets here and there to um to to change the portfolio mix and get some synergies,is really very accretive can maybe swap assets here and there to change the portfolio mix and get some synergies,
um,nordex i ll come to that in a minute but um acquiring existing assets um asset by asset is not part,i ll come to that in a minute but acquiring existing assets asset by asset is not part of our,
um,to that in a minute but um acquiring existing assets um asset by asset is not part of our um investment,to that in a minute but acquiring existing assets asset by asset is not part of our investment investment plan,
um,assets um asset by asset is not part of our um investment uh investment plan i mean on the nordex pipeline,acquiring existing assets asset by asset is not part of our investment investment plan i mean on the nordics pipeline,

um,wind conditions uh clusters in in geographic proximity that that um they provide efficiencies and um i mean i can i,due diligence and in geographic proximity that will provide efficiencies and i mean i will not talk about specific locations,
um,in geographic proximity that that um they provide efficiencies and um i mean i can i will not talk about specific,the due diligence and in geographic proximity that will provide efficiencies and i mean i will not talk about specific,
um,a minute but i cannot talk about specific sites uh um i mean we can we can give you more color,i mean i will not talk about specific locations now now because the transaction is not closed and we are,
um,i mean we can we can give you more color um after the closing of the transaction um what we have,i will give you more color in a you more color after the closing of the transaction what we have,
um,you more color um after the closing of the transaction um what we have already said is 15 of the pipeline,you more color after the closing of the transaction what we have already said is 15 of the pipeline is,
um,we have already said is 15 of the pipeline is um is close to fid or very late development stage and,have already said is 15 of the pipeline is close to fid or very late development stage and we expect,
um,that we have by 25 another 500 megawatts under operations um including the the purchase price of 400 2 5 million,that we have by 25 another 500 megawatt under operations including the purchase price of 402 5 million we expect,
um,to 8 but please i mean this is a very um um mature market and we had to buy it so,to 8 but please i mean this is a very mature market and we had to so don t expect,
um,8 but please i mean this is a very um um mature market and we had to buy it so don,but please i mean this is a very mature market and we had to so don t expect it at,
um,the upper end of the 4 5 to 8 but um clearly in the in the range we saw the price,of the four and a half to eight percent but clearly in the in the range we saw the price,
um,pipelines we ve participated in many due diligence in france um so we know also our other pipelines look like and,other pipelines we participated in many due diligence in france so we know also our other pipelines look like and,
um,that but i mean that is very difficult comparing prices um on that level pipeline by pipeline the split of the,that but i mean that is very difficult comparing prices on that level pipeline by pipeline the majority of the,
um,or less in line with the maturity of our overall um of our overall pipeline i mean around as i said,majority of the pipeline is more or less in line with the majority of our overall pipeline i mean around,
um,peter bisztyga from bofa securities please go ahead hi yeah um thanks for taking my question so just a another one,peter bestiga from bofa securities capacity please and then my second question as she was just on carbon which has,
um,then my second question as she was just on carbon um which has obviously been uh very volatile uh over the,please and then my second question as she was just on carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the,
um,has obviously been uh very volatile uh over the last um couple of quarters i guess your supply and trading division,carbon which has obviously been very volatile over the last couple of quarters i guess your supply and trading division,
um,supply and trading division might have profited from that but um i was just wondering could you could you give us,quarters i guess your supply and trading division might have profited from that i was just wondering could you give,
um,to what s actually been driving the carbon price particularly um you know as it reached the sort of mid to,to what s actually been driving the carbon price particularly you know as it s reached the sort of mid,
um,high twenties thank you yeah peter thanks for the question um on the nordex pipeline yes it will come on top,high twenties thank you peter thanks for the question including the 400 million and i mean we have a lot,
um,have said with the announcement of the transaction and now um question regarding um um funding i mean as i ve,me start with the second part of the question yeah i mean i think we will learn about it over,
um,the announcement of the transaction and now um question regarding um um funding i mean as i ve said in the,option can be exercised the completion of the transaction is also subject to foreign investment clearance in france and the,
um,announcement of the transaction and now um question regarding um um funding i mean as i ve said in the speech,the first question on negative prices i mean for us i mean we have seen it it in the uk,
um,funding i mean as i ve said in the speech um we expect um to be within the leverage target um,to 1 15 billion euros and we expect it to be in the middle of the range due to the,
um,as i ve said in the speech um we expect um to be within the leverage target um of the three,and we expect it to be in the middle of the range due to the negative one of in the,4368670
um,um we expect um to be within the leverage target um of the three times net debt to ebitda um including,in the net debt figure at age one we see a leveraged factor of around three times net debt to,
um,target um of the three times net debt to ebitda um including the 400 million and i mean we have a,high high twenties thank you peter thanks for the question including the 400 million and i mean we have a,
um,time that s why are confident if we move up um then it s really come down without impacting the capex,that s why we are confident if we move up up then it will come down without impacting the capex,
um,do cuds that will be part of the of the um capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted to,mean when we do cods that will be part of the capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted,
um,capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted to um it will come on top of our existing targets but,the capital allocation approach but of course as i hinted to it will come on top happening of our size,
um,of our size and carbon sorry carbon sorry exactly carbon um yeah i mean even even within the team here we,will come on top happening of our size carl sorry carl yeah i mean even within the team here we,
um,see the market short term is more bearish uh because um i mean with the covid situation with uh very low,see whether we still have time perfect thank you because i think that s the more interesting one but i,
um,much lower than it has been it has been expected um on the other hand it s also clear that the,i think that can go the one way or the other i mean it s too early i mean we,
um,by 2030 a significant part of that uh maybe even um more than half needs to come from the euets and,that s a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the eu ets and,
um,that a lot of industrials who were sitting on excess um certificates um were in financial trouble and they needed to,that a lot of industrials who are sitting on excess certificates long term and since this market is nothing you,
um,lot of industrials who were sitting on excess um certificates um were in financial trouble and they needed to sell um,a lot of industrials who are sitting on excess certificates long term and since this market is nothing you can,
um,um were in financial trouble and they needed to sell um just to to get to get liquidity this is with,to build and then when they were close to fid and they got them to the auction they sold the,
um,these are the two camps uh short term long term um and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally analyze,of industrials who are sitting on excess certificates long term and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally analyze,
um,vp with a 50 gigawatts next target by by 2030 um company like yourself would be like a plug and play,know vp with a 50 gigawatts net target by 2030 company like yourself would be like a plug and play,
um,for you to fend off a fact like this one um yeah alberto thanks for the thanks for the question i,you to fend off a threat like this one yeah alberto thanks for the question we just said we currently,
um,is to valid which we have set in the past um i mean the e on state is not tied to,they have done in the past and we close our strategic gap and the team is not there just to,
um,also back the leak net provisions by other financial portfolios um and i mean when you look at the the the,also back the lignard provisions by other financial portfolios and when you look at the potential sourcing of financing yes,
um,and the other half would be available to capital rotation um but um i mean that has not changed it s,and the other half would be available to capital i start with the old question and then let s see,
um,other half would be available to capital rotation um but um i mean that has not changed it s exactly what,and the other half would be available to capital i start with the old question and then let s see,
um,has not changed it s exactly what we said before um usually we have two questions so you have three which,cannot sustain i mean cannot grow i mean we should now i mean we should stick to the two questions,
um,it could that we couldn t and the situation that um it s the race for scarcity because i mean it,that we couldn t end up in a situation that it s the race for scarcity because that is not,
um,investment plans of everybody around in this in this field um it s almost impossible to employ that amount of money,it s a very i mean in terms of addition to the cost base it s almost not relevant i,
um,times to do it so existing pipelines become much more um valuable i think the investors of big oil and others,we also don t see a limiting factor is funds because if you have good projects i think investors are,
um,a green investment if you buy existing stuff from others um because that is not a positive contribution um it s,up in a situation that it s the race for scarcity because that is not a positive contribution it s,
um,from others um because that is not a positive contribution um it s just i mean um over bidding in prices,because that is not a positive contribution it s just i mean over bidding in prices so i mean on,
um,not a positive contribution um it s just i mean um over bidding in prices so i mean on the question,not a positive contribution it s just i mean over bidding in prices so i mean on the question whether,
um,figuring that out and we sit and wait what happened um got it well i mean that s speculation i mean,figuring that out and beast it and wait what happened got it well i mean that s speculation what i,
um,pipeline which actually needed to be developed over a decade um and of course we have have investment discipline and we,deep pipeline which actually needed to be developed over a decade and of course we have an investment discipline and,
um,we will continue doing that i mean developing our pipeline um investing in good projects and also being on the technological,we will continue doing that i mean developing our pipeline investing being on the technological forefront be it batteries be,
um,technological forefront be it battery speed h2 or be it um floating off shore where i actually don t see limiting,technological forefront be it batteries be it h2 or be it floating offshore where i actually don t see limiting,
um,if you have good projects i think investors are actually um looking for investment opportunities and now you need to ask,if you have good projects i think investors are actually looking for investment opportunities and now you need to ask,
um,of rob pauline from morgan stanley please go ahead hi um yes good afternoon everyone um so um first question markus,of rob pauline from morgan stanley please go ahead yeah hi rob pulling i rejoined to ask another question if,
um,stanley please go ahead hi um yes good afternoon everyone um so um first question markus um is um please talk,sam ari from ubs please go ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation i just wanted to ask,
um,go ahead hi um yes good afternoon everyone um so um first question markus um is um please talk about the,go ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns,
um,yes good afternoon everyone um so um first question markus um is um please talk about the eu recovery fund um,hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns and one,
um,afternoon everyone um so um first question markus um is um please talk about the eu recovery fund um and how,the end of the year but it s going well and on the european recovery fund let me start with,
um,um is um please talk about the eu recovery fund um and how do you think internally that rwe will benefit,it s been an issue with you for the second quarter and do you think the negative price will be,
um,do you think internally that rwe will benefit from this um and a a second part to that not a second,line of rob pulling from morgan stanley please go ahead and there s a second part to that another second,
um,into actual projects cause that s still seems very unclear um and the second question and hopefully a lot simpler um,into actual projects because that still seems very unclear and the second question and hopefully a lot simpler is you,
um,um and the second question and hopefully a lot simpler um is you have security to make your agent in uk,seems very unclear and the second question and hopefully a lot simpler is you have secure to make ridge in,
um,is you have security to make your agent in uk um could you provide an update on the process you have,you have secure to make ridge in the uk could you provide an update on the process you have for,
um,liked that the cmd namely greater gabbard galloper and rampion um has that been successful is that underway or is that,at the cmd namely gratid gabbard gallipur and rampian has that been successful is that underway or is that not,
um,you uh let me start with the easier one rob um i mean we are working on the lease extensions and,thank you let me start with the easier one rob i mean we are working on the lease extensions and,
um,i mean we are working on the lease extensions and um we it will be around 800 to 1 2 800,i mean we are working on the lease extensions and it will be around 800 megawatt to 1 2 gigawatt,
um,to 1 2 800 megawatts to 1 2 gigawatts and um we are optimistic that we can uh finalize it and,are working on the lease extensions and it will be around 800 megawatt to 1 2 gigawatt finalize it and,
um,uh finalize it and by then uh book it as um as uh at least secured by the end of the,to 1 2 gigawatt finalize it and by then book it as at least secured by the end of the,
um,uh at least secured by the end of the year um but it s going um it s going well um,and by then book it as at least secured by the end of the year but it s going well,
um,the end of the year um but it s going um it s going well um and uh on the european,it as at least secured by the end of the year but it s going well and on the european,
um,um but it s going um it s going well um and uh on the european recovery fund let me start,by the end of the year but it s going well and on the european recovery fund let me start,
um,let me start with the second part of the question um yeah i mean i think we will we will we,let me start with the second part of the question yeah i mean i think we will learn about it,
um,we will we will learn about it over the next um let s say two quarters until the end of the,i think we will learn about it over the next let s say two quarters until the end of the,
um,financing i mean it s it s still totally unclear um and um the only thing what we can do and,it s simpler financing i mean it s still totally unclear and the only thing what we can do and,
um,mean it s it s still totally unclear um and um the only thing what we can do and that s,simpler financing i mean it s still totally unclear and the only thing what we can do and that s,
um,the first part of your question i mean we are um we are also now actively looking especially in in the,do and that s the first part of your question is it better our money or there and how do,
um,the important step now is to get the right partners um together and thinking through um what is feasible and you,think the important step now is to get the right partners together and think it through what is feasible and,
um,to get the right partners um together and thinking through um what is feasible and you should usually start with the,to get the right partners together and think it through what is feasible and you should usually start with the,
um,actually needs the hydrogen and then uh you you do um you backward yet um and i mean i think these,think it through what is feasible and you should usually start with the demand and i mean i think these,
um,and then uh you you do um you backward yet um and i mean i think these are the big fears,and you should usually start with the demand and i mean i think these are the big fields it s,
um,and i mean i think these are the big fears um our account business already saw especially renewables and storage technology,mean i think these are the big fields it s our current business already so especially renewables and storage technology,
um,to wait a couple of years before it is relevant um in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability,wait a couple of years before it is relevant in in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability,
um,in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability um and maybe um the kickstart of the of the solar,it is relevant in in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability maybe the kickstart of the solar,
um,investments but also in terms of profitability um and maybe um the kickstart of the of the solar and wind business,investments but also in terms of profitability maybe the kickstart of the solar and wind business is a good proxy,
um,interesting thank you very much and good luck with the um with the lease function thank you we will update you,interesting thank you very much and good luck with the with the lease the lease rounds thank you we will,
um,ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation and um uh uh great results today i just wanted to ask,ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns and,
um,uh uh great results today i just wanted to ask um two questions one on returns and one on farm down,everybody thanks for the presentation i just wanted to ask two questions one on returns and one on farm bound,
um,one on farm down so one on returns i think um you had spoken at the cmd about 100 to 300,returns and one on farm bound so on returns i think you had spoken at the cmd about 100 to,
um,sound that crazy as an estimate of the watts actually um as well and i don t know the lower the,hands that crazy as an estimate of the whack actually as well and i don t know the lower the,
um,for the discussion i mean on returns i agree that um we definitely see that the vex are coming coming down,for the discussion i mean on returns i agree that we we definitely see that the wacs are coming down,
um,and you also put now very low numbers to vex um which i think is is the right thing um and,and you also put now very low numbers to vex which i think is the right thing potentially the absolute,
um,vex um which i think is is the right thing um and um but i m not there that i would,vex which i think is the right thing potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the absolute returns,
um,which i think is is the right thing um and um but i m not there that i would say we,which i think is the right thing potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the absolute returns of,
um,would say we see now low single digit returns for um for for offshore that s not where we are i,a year or two ago it was common to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to,
um,out of an un levered project of 650 basis points um for the for the investment program we have outlined until,now than to keep it open so it is our net investment target i mean we have outlined a net,
um,the for the investment program we have outlined until 2022 um potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the,numbers to vex which i think is the right thing potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the,
um,you talk about the absolute level i m not at um low medium i mean low for me is three and,not the value creation but the absolute returns of the next a thumb down i m not sure whether i,
um,tender decide to give you one example for taiwan that um local i mean local production becomes a dominant theme that,design to give you one example for taiwan that local production becomes a dominant theme that if you want to,
um,local i mean local production becomes a dominant theme that um if you want to put money in some place you,example for taiwan that local production becomes a dominant theme that if you want to put money in some place,
um,you ve accelerated the fully hedged portion particularly in 2022 um obviously it s a quite a small chart but from,you ve accelerated the fully hedged portion particularly in 2022 obviously it s a quite start but from maybe roughly,
um,offshore assets that you might be looking to sell down um john thanks for the question i mean on hedging you,offshore assets that you might be looking to sell down john thanks for the question i mean on hedging you,
um,but we actually closed by that was the spread position um is there i mean what you could read into it,the outright hedge so what we actually closed by that was the spread position what you could read into it,
um,there i mean what you could read into it is um if you think spreads are fair is part of of,the spread position what you could read into it is if you think spreads are fair fair is part of,
um,is part of of de risking now to close it um and um i think if you look at current market,fair fair is part of de risking now to close it and i think if you look at current market,
um,of of de risking now to close it um and um i think if you look at current market prices and,of de risking now to close it and i think if you look at current market prices and spread i,
um,to lock that in you better close that position now um and that s what we have done that doesn t,prices and spread i think everybody expects a hundred percent and that s what we have done that doesn t,
um,to lock it in now than to keep it open um on the leverage side um the three times a net,to lock it in now than to keep it open so it is our net investment target i mean we,
um,than to keep it open um on the leverage side um the three times a net debt to ebitda includes our,now than to keep it open so it is our net investment target i mean we have outlined a net,
um,investment target i mean we have outlined a net investment um of around 1 5 to 2 billion per annum so,investment target i mean we have outlined a net investment of around 1 5 to 2 billion per annum so,
um,around 1 5 to 2 billion per annum so if um we re gonna invest gross more uh given the the,around 1 5 to 2 billion per annum so if we re going to invest more given the profile then,
um,also includes divestment i have already said that we divested um which is not yet in the financials uh georgia biomass,also includes divestment i have already said that we divested which is not yet in the financials georgia biomass for,
um,biomass for close to 200 million 175 and some adjustments um and um i mean on the other things we are,the financials georgia biomass for close to 200 million 1 75 and some adjustments on the other things we are,
um,close to 200 million 175 and some adjustments um and um i mean on the other things we are considering our,georgia biomass for close to 200 million 1 75 and some adjustments on the other things we are considering our,
um,mean on the other things we are considering our options um so um we will bring it to the net figure,75 and some adjustments on the other things we are considering our options because we always said that the leading,
um,the other things we are considering our options um so um we will bring it to the net figure but i,the other things we are considering our options because we always said that the leading matrix is 13 gigawatt net,
um,if you now want to get a comment on the um on the on the rumors on this providence i mean,some flexibility and i mean if you now want to get a comment on the rumors on disposals i mean,
um,uh thank you uh so my two questions for inaudible um in the us so if we do have a possibility,bernstein please go ahead so my two questions are certainly in the us so if you do have a possible,
um,election outcome in the us on our business i mean um i mean even today i mean many things depend on,t expect a significant impact from a potential federal election outcome and even today i mean many things depend on,
um,today i mean many things depend on non state level um of course the tech support is a federal thing um,even today i mean many things depend on state level of course the tech support is a federal thing but,
um,um of course the tech support is a federal thing um but also the current administration um extended the ptcs uh,on state level of course the tech support is a federal thing but also the current administration extended the ptcs,
um,is a federal thing um but also the current administration um extended the ptcs uh given the covid situation so i,tech support is a federal thing but also the current administration extended the ptcs given the covid situation so i,
um,i would say it will not make a huge difference um and uh on germany um of course we would like,pure speculation i would say it will not make a huge difference and on germany of course we would like,
um,not make a huge difference um and uh on germany um of course we would like to do more in onshore,not make a huge difference and on germany of course we would like to do more in onshore and onshore,
um,course we would like to do more in onshore and um in onshore in germany um and we see under subscribed,germany of course we would like to do more in onshore and onshore in germany and we see under subscribed,
um,do more in onshore and um in onshore in germany um and we see under subscribed options the problem is that,like to do more in onshore and onshore in germany and we see under subscribed auctions the problem is that,
um,options the problem is that the projects are not ready um to be bid into the options um we have permitting,subscribed auctions the problem is that the projects are not ready to be bit into the auctions we have permitting,
um,are not ready um to be bid into the options um we have permitting issues we have um pending law cases,the projects are not ready to be bit into the auctions we have permitting issues we have pending law cases,
um,into the options um we have permitting issues we have um pending law cases and so on but there is some,into the auctions we have permitting issues we have pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting,
um,law cases and so on but there is some interesting um development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled a,pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled,
um,wanna accelerate the permitting process and the court proceedings and um they also introduced something which is now heavily discussed also,into the auctions we have permitting issues we have pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting,
um,heavily discussed also with the ngos that even if you um if you dispute a permission in court um that should,equilibrium i mean yeah actually then lignite and then hard code so if you take out hardcore now that shouldn,
um,if you um if you dispute a permission in court um that should still until the decision is there allow the,or two days ago where they really want to accelerate the should still until the decision is there allow the,
um,the decision is there allow the construction to go on um and that would be both very helpful so speedier processes,until the decision is there allow the construction to go on and that would be both very helpful so speedy,
um,don t need to go to the hierarchy and also um that nobody can by pure tactics in the court uh,don t need to go to the hierarchy and also that nobody can buy pure tactics in the court delay,
um,can by pure tactics in the court uh delay projects um but let s see how the draft will go through,nobody can buy pure tactics in the court delay projects but let s see how the draft will go through,
um,this is petro solowski from ct i have two questions um the first one would be a small on nordex uh,it s piotr drenczowski from citi i have a significant number small number in annual euro figure as you take,
um,cost as you take over the whole company and secondly um i wanted to ask you on this year to go,as you take over the whole company and secondly i wanted to ask you on the co2 to go back,
um,addition to the cost base it s almost not relevant um i mean the most relevant one will be uh the,addition to the cost base it s almost not relevant i mean the most relevant one will be the devex,
um,uh the webex for the project and then the capex um on co2 equilibrium i mean um yeah actually the interesting,be the devex for the project and then the capex on co2 equilibrium i mean yeah actually then lignite and,
um,and then the capex um on co2 equilibrium i mean um yeah actually the interesting thing is that the current co2,and then the capex on co2 equilibrium i mean yeah actually then lignite and then hard code so if you,
um,gas uh the gas taking most of the times looks um gas first then liquid and then um hard coal so,the project and then the capex on co2 equilibrium i mean yeah actually then lignite and then hard code so,
um,the times looks um gas first then liquid and then um hard coal so if you take out um hard coal,capex on co2 equilibrium i mean yeah actually then lignite and then hard code so if you take out hardcore,
um,and then um hard coal so if you take out um hard coal now that shouldn t change the equilibrium between,then lignite and then hard code so if you take out hardcore now that shouldn t change the equilibrium between,
um,hard coal now that shouldn t change the equilibrium between um for the co2 relevant shoot switching price there shouldn t,now that shouldn t change the equilibrium between for the co2 relevant fuel switching price there shouldn t be a,
um,above the current inaudible level uh that can only be um explained that actually the industry expects a shortage and um,trading above the count fuel searching level that can only be explained that actually the industry expects a shortage but,
um,um explained that actually the industry expects a shortage and um this is always difficult to judge because this market is,be explained that actually the industry expects a shortage but this is always difficult to judge because this market is,
um,always difficult to judge because this market is not uh um in any of the market it s also since you,but this is always difficult to judge because this market is not an annual market it s also since you,
um,also since you can easily keep your certificates for longer um you can also say it s partly a view on,also since you can easily keep your certificates for longer you can also say it s partly a view on,
um,partly a view on what to come in future years um so i would not overrate uh the annual price which,partly a view on what to come in future years so i would not overrate the annual price switching that,
um,know you can t recoup it yourself with it so um is that uh have you seen it being an issue,investment opportunities and now you need to ask yourself who actually brings what s to the table i mean the,
um,with you for the uh for the second quarter and um do you think the negative prices will become more or,with you for the second quarter and do you think the negative price will be some more or less prevalent,
um,less prevalent going forward the second question is on hydrogen um it can um w where do you think the value,think the negative price will be some more or less prevalent quite forward time where do you think the value,
um,forward the second question is on hydrogen um it can um w where do you think the value will lie is,price will be some more or less prevalent quite forward time where do you think the value will lie is,
um,and will you be a big player there thank you um if i could answer the last question laugh um life,will be and will you be a big player then thank you if i could answer the last question life,
um,you um if i could answer the last question laugh um life would be easier if i think it s too,player then thank you if i could answer the last question life would be easier i think it s too,
um,framework look like and how big will the market become um and of course it has has the two angles you,the incentivization framework look like and how big will the market become and of course it has two angles you,
um,green production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen um and um in the end it will be then kind,incentivize green production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen and in the end it will be then kind,
um,and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen um and um in the end it will be then kind of demand,production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen and in the end it will be then kind of a,
um,different angles where i actually don t see scarcity in um the production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers i,different angles where i actually don t see scarcity as the production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers where,
um,mean that s a proven technology where we definitely have um scarcity already today is um renewable projects because um i,production of green hydrogen in terms of electrolyzers where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects because i,
um,technology where we definitely have um scarcity already today is um renewable projects because um i mean um if you believe,in terms of electrolyzers where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects because i mean if you believe,
um,have um scarcity already today is um renewable projects because um i mean um if you believe um on the demand,electrolyzers where we definitely have scarcity already today is renewable projects because i mean if you believe all the demand,
um,already today is um renewable projects because um i mean um if you believe um on the demand for our gas,already today is renewable projects because i mean if you believe all the demand forecasts and i have no doubts,
um,renewable projects because um i mean um if you believe um on the demand for our gas and i have no,scarcity already today is renewable projects because i mean if you believe all the demand forecasts and i have no,
um,uh a good assessment we need so much green energy um that every project which is actually in the pipeline of,is a good assessment we need so much green energy that every project which is actually in the pipeline of,
um,a question of time so this is really a scarcity um on the demand side i think that will be a,a question of time i think that will be a competition by the off takers who can do it cheaper,
um,where i see our role it s definitely on the um production side green power potentially depending on how the consortia,where i see our role it s definitely on the production side green power potentially depending on how the consortia,
um,i mean for us i mean we have seen it um in the uk and germany but um it s not,i mean for us i mean we have seen it it in the uk and germany but it was not,
um,have seen it um in the uk and germany but um it s not uh it was not a relevant issue,mean we have seen it it in the uk and germany but it was not a relevant issue i mean,
um,unk from unk please go ahead yes hi thank you um two questions from my side as well i was just,from the line of deepa vinkatesharan from bernstein please go ahead so my two questions are certainly in the us,
um,proposition from commodity and i guess the second question is um relating to that i think you mentioned earlier right this,proposition from promotably and i guess the second question is relating to that i think you mentioned earlier right this,
um,of benefit benefi you quite beneficial thank you yeah perfect um thanks for the question i mean on um i would,of benefits leave it quite beneficial thank you yeah but thanks for the question i mean i would not say,
um,yeah perfect um thanks for the question i mean on um i would not say that we failed on france because,you yeah but thanks for the question i mean i would not say that we failed on france because we,
um,on france because where we we were simply not present um it was always a strategic target to get a foot,on france because we were simply not present and the nordx team was actually very successful in the french market,
um,the auction they sold the projects to their potential customers um and i mean what what is the value creation potential,the auction they sold the projects to their potential customers and i mean what is the value creation potential for,
um,done in the past and we close our strategic gap um and the team is not there just to deliver the,done in the past and we close our strategic gap and the team is not there just to deliver the,
um,develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive um it s it s not not so densely populated like,they will continuously develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive it s not so densely populated like,
um,so densely populated like germany so you have more space um they have huge build outs target and even better remuneration,not so densely populated like germany so you have more space definitely create value and i mean we are a,
um,framework with a double sided 20 year inflation linked cfd um so if you believe that um um onshore wind in,market with i mean the double sided cfd for 20 years in inflation link we have seen prices in the,
um,year inflation linked cfd um so if you believe that um um onshore wind in france is good it will definitely,cheaper that s nothing for us i mean if you ask me where i see our role it s definitely,
um,inflation linked cfd um so if you believe that um um onshore wind in france is good it will definitely create,market overall is very attractive it s not so densely populated like germany so you have more space definitely create,
um,a firm believer that also the political environment in france um and their targets was to go straight from nuclear to,a firm believer that also the political environment in france and their targets to go straight from nuclear to renewables,
um,their targets was to go straight from nuclear to renewables um will not be will not be questioned by some of,environment in france and their targets to go straight from nuclear to renewables will not be questioned by some of,
um,to be honest i mean if you look into that um we are very wind heavy so doing more on the,to close if you look into our offshore pipeline there is in terms of cod dates and that s historically,
um,doing more on the solar side would definitely be good um let s see how we can achieve it i mean,discussion i mean on returns i agree that we we definitely see that the wacs are coming down i mean,
um,achieve it i mean we have definitely ramped up our um our development activities and you will see uh more to,mean i m nordic it s easy i mean we take over the company yes but it s a development,

um,time next year maybe a little bit earlier than that um does that answer your question it it does it does,time next year make it a little bit earlier than that did that answer your question it does it does,
um,know you mentioned about that volumes and product mix maybe um could you expand on it so we could make like,up on the gross margins as we mentioned about the volumes and product mix could you expand on it a,
um,the end of the day it s we re selling um without getting too deep into it we we re selling,the end of the day it s we re selling we re getting too deep into we re we re,
um,step back and look at what our business has done um we ve really made the transition from copper to fiber,step back and look at what our business is done we ve really made the transition from copper to fiber,
um,and stuff just have a richer mix we also have um based off of international and domestic revenue mix we have,stuff just have a richer mix we also have um based off of international and domestic revenue mix we have,
um,s happening in the fiber space is we re selling um the mix towards llps is much higher got it crosstalk,s happening in the fiber space is we re selling the mix towards olps is much higher i know all,
um,i think the variability also like the thing to to um maybe think about paul and you know we don t,for the corners i think the variability also the thing that maybe you think about oh and we don t,
um,and see but there s no doubt that the pressure um some of the pressure s been alleviated in places like,and see that there s no doubt that the pressure some of the pressure has been alleviated and places like,
um,over i think now it s over 50 million but um we don t break that up one quick final question,me pick an arrow it s over 50 million but we don t break that out a quick final question,
um,revenues you re expecting from these new tier one wins um how like do you all have any visibility as to,assuming you get the revenues you re expecting from these new 2 1 wins you ll have any visibility as,
um,would it be or would it be accreted any sense um it would so i m gonna talk to you about,load of would it be a credo any sense i m going to talk to you about international gross margins,
um,gazelo of tyson capital your line your line is open um thank you a couple of different questions first of all,from line of bill dezello of titan capital your line is open thank you couple of different questions first of,
um,about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and um is that different than your comment about wait in the,about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and is is that different than your comment about late in,
um,start with the first one of course and it s um uh the the first half ramp that i was talking,first one of course and it s about the first one okay the first half ramp that i was talking,
um,previous sdx awards the three customers that we talked about um and and really i m talking about in totality there,the previous sdx awards three customers that we ve talked about and really i m talking about in totality there,
um,there is some different dates on all of those but um we ll start seeing as a combination we ll start,totality there are some different dates on all of those but we ll start saying as a combination will start,
um,start seeing material revenue round the half of next year um as far as the new ones uh one of them,will start seeing material revenue around the half of next year as far as the new ones one of them,
um,this it s a as far as seeing any revenue um i think it s i i don t have a,fairly quick but it s as far as seeing any revenue i think it s i don t have a,
um,kind of want to see how it how it works um the other one is very uh specific and mike i,kind of see how it works the other one is very specific and mike i don t recall the date,
um,of next year yes right and that one is big um it s a well known customer to us um they,of next year okay yes and that one is big it s a well known customer to us and they,
um,big um it s a well known customer to us um they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets,big it s a well known customer to us and they have very specific plans with very specific revenue targets,
um,specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it um the current data is third quarter of next year i,specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it the current date is the third quarter of next year,
um,concern other than yeah it it it really hasn t um you know we ve been operating in a relatively shut,that concern other than you know it really hasn t you know we ve been operating in a relatively shut,
um,anyways from the end user demand uh really no difference um and we haven t seen any near term changes um,down environment anyways from the end user demand really no difference and we haven t seen any near term changes,
um,um and we haven t seen any near term changes um in in in the way that they re operating where,and we haven t seen any near term changes in the way that they re operating really affects us is,
um,operating where it really affects us is when you re um trying to meet with customers and and really you know,operating really affects us is when you re trying to meet with customers and really you know the lab activity,
um,around the world right now it tends to impact that um so far we ve been able to maneuver around that,around the world right now it tends to impact that so far we ve been able to maneuver around that,
um,m not aware of any material delay because of the um the quarantine situation that we re in and i i,not aware of any material delay because of the quarantine situation that we re in and i don t expect,
um,in and i i don t expect it i think um especially our bigger customers even our smaller customer now i,in and i don t expect it i think especially our bigger customers even our small customers now i think,
um,smaller customer now i think about going on in europe um have kind of developed an environment where we can talk,customers now i think about going on in europe have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to,
um,while you hear about a week delay here or there um and but that s that s not that frequent and,while you hear about a week delay here or there but that s not that frequent the deployment is not,
um,know europe what we were seeing is as far as um infrastructure in especially with the new awards we re talking,in europe what we were seeing is as far as infrastructure and especially with the new awards we re talking,
um,they have or expanding footprints in many cases there s um been no change in those plans all right thank you,they have or expanding footprints in many cases there s been no change in those plans great and if i,
um,you seeing with uh your important customers uh down there um so there e in the caribbean we re actually doing,america but what are you seeing with your important customers down there so in the caribbean we re actually doing,
um,the caribbean we re actually doing well we have some um strong um i don t i don t want to,down there so in the caribbean we re actually doing well we have some strong i don t want to,
um,we re actually doing well we have some um strong um i don t i don t want to overplay it,so in the caribbean we re actually doing well we have some strong i don t want to overplay it,
um,spx maybe you know the spx is kind of the um architecture people i go to and so there are large,you you know the sdx is kind of the architecture people want to go to and so there are large,
um,activity going on there those tend to be longer term um we do have one traditional customer down there um there,s activity going on there those tend to be longer term when you do have one traditional customer down there,
um,term um we do have one traditional customer down there um there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer but there,when you do have one traditional customer down there there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer but there s,
um,your line is open hello sorry i was on mute um i apologize if you ve already addressed this uh but,partners your line is open hello sorry i was on mute i apologize if you ve already addressed this but,
um,but are you seeing any significant pull in of orders um from your customers um no no um we we did,addressed this but are you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers um no no we did,
um,any significant pull in of orders um from your customers um no no um we we did at the beginning of,you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers um no no we did at the beginning of,
um,in of orders um from your customers um no no um we we did at the beginning of the pandemic so,significant pull in of orders from your customers um no no we did at the beginning of the pandemic so,
um,of q1 we saw a material increase in order activity um i think at this point in time uh i i,of q1 we saw a material increase in older activity i think at this point in time i would say,
um,what their demand is i don t see any real um you we do on particular parts i i ve talked,rate is reflecting what their demand is i don t see any real we do on particular parts i talked,
um,the fact that we re still having some supply issues um most predominantly with silicon but um and in those cases,fact that we re still having some supply issues most predominantly with silicon but in those cases we may really,
um,having some supply issues um most predominantly with silicon but um and in those cases we may really try to nail,still having some supply issues most predominantly with silicon but in those cases we may really try to mail down,
um,come from that is a really good question yeah so um we are adding tier one customers as well so the,customer concentration it s most of the question yeah so we are adding tier one customers as well so the,
um,to kind of spread the the fluctuations uh around within um but having said that we re also adding more tier,1s to kind of spread the fluctuations uh around within um but having said that we re also adding more,
um,ones so you know you ve got the that issue um we are adding tier threes and i and i use,to one so you know you ve got that issue we are adding tier 3s and i use tier 3s,
um,types we re having municipalities on a very fast clip um i mean we usually have an internal announcement here or,all different types heading municipalities on a very fast clip i mean we usually have an internal announcement here or,
um,large percentage of those were these alternate type carriers so um so if from that perspective and by the way i,on customers large percentage of those were de spaulterinite type carriers so from that perspective and by the way i,
um,to that alternate carrier that municipal space tier three space um so and and and utilities so that base is growing,of our conduits to that alternate carry that municipal space tier three space and utilities so that base is growing,
um,so and and and utilities so that base is growing um now when we get into this time next year um,space and utilities so that base is growing now when we get into this time next year still be kind,
um,um now when we get into this time next year um it ll still be kind of early in the cycle,base is growing now when we get into this time next year still be kind of early in the cycle,
um,three that i have no doubt will be more diverse um but we re adding tier ones that are you know,the i have no doubt we ll be more diverse but we re adding tier 1s at a you know,
um,are you know at a nice clip as well so um but we will have more customers which will help in,you know at a nice clip as well but we will have more customers which will help in that diversity,
um,will have more customers which will help in that diversity um and then one other thing i just want to add,will have more customers which will help in that diversity and then one other thing i just wanted to add,
um,some of our new wifi solutions is really going well um which will help add in that that product diversity as,and some of our new wi fi solutions is really going well which will help add in that product diversity,
um,shift towards fiber is ongoing and they should you know um the probably the tier ones around the world just migrating,towards father s ongoing initiative you know with all the to make the tier ones around the world just migrating,
um,of that was copper based that that died and then um which which caused us an issue but really it it,programs really one big program that was copper based that died and which caused us an issue but really it,
um,but really it it was the longevity of the copper um and the inaudible associated with that copper versus the fiber,issue but really it was the longevity of the copper and the the hardware requirements associated with that copper versus,
um,you re really seeing fiber eclipse copper within our revenue um and so to us that s a big milestone um,you we re really saying fiber eclipses copper within our revenue so to us that s a big milestone and,
um,um and so to us that s a big milestone um um and it really because there s a lot of,within our revenue so to us that s a big milestone and it really because there s a lot of,

um,you know 60 maybe they could keep up with that um rate of growth i assume for planning purposes you know,grow you know 60 maybe they could keep up with that way to grow ties to for planning purposes you,
um,know our off ramping up in some other positive drivers um just just to begin with and you know can we,know our not ramping up and some other positive drivers just just to begin with and you know can we,
um,answer for you today so it it it for that um the thing about the tier threes is not just a,answer for you today so the thing about the tier three is not just let me just say off carriers,
um,broader than traditional tier three carriers but the thing about um these these carriers is the growth rate through the year,broader than traditional two or three carriers but the thing about these carriers is the growth rate through the year,
um,two quarters of growth before these you know the the um really that one mammoth tier one in in europe that,have two quarters of growth before for these you know really we have one mammoth two in one in europe,

um,if i can some of the last rounds of questions um when you talk about uh the the 4q roll forward,clarify if i can some of the last rounds of questions and when you talk about the 4q roll forward,
um,hope your you and your family are doing well too um just to clarify we will uh our history has been,and your family are we ll see you in a bit just to clarify we will our history has been,
um,to clarify we will uh our history has been to um add another year into the into the outlook so 2025,clarify we will our history has been to add another year into the outlook so 2025 would be that year,
um,or it we ve we ve look at it as um showing the the core business as uh as the driver,schedule items we talked about today or we ve looked at it as showing the core business as the driver,
um,that would be the intent going forward i think that um when i ve been asked this question before the answer,that would be the intent going forward i think that what i ve been asked this question before the answer,
um,at least try to put some more parameters around what um each of these pieces of the process could take so,at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take such,
um,may be too early yeah so it in terms of um you know there there s uh people have uh realized,too early yeah so in terms of you know if people have realized out there and we ve been asked,
um,our original schedule uh schedules that some of these uh um inaudible lags that you know to prepare the the environmental,expected in our original schedule that some of these nois you know to prepare the environmental impact statement would be,
um,out by now so these are expected i i believe um you know that that plans scheduled for reviewing uh uh,out by now so these are expected i believe you know the plan schedule for reviewing and releasing needs is,
um,does that impact your your future project timelines yeah the um these notice of in of intent they contain um a,does that impact your future project time lines yeah you ve noticed a bit of intense that they contain a,
um,the um these notice of in of intent they contain um a plan schedule you know that that in the analyze,you ve noticed a bit of intense that they contain a planned schedule you know that in those nlis they,
um,each of the costs so that would be an important um piece of information to to have available so that that,reviewing each of the clocks so that would be an important piece of information to have available so that s,
um,vineyard right yes yes oh okay yeah i m not um i i apologize um you d probably have to ask,one for vineyard right yes yes yes okay yeah i m not yeah i apologize you probably have to ask,
um,oh okay yeah i m not um i i apologize um you d probably have to ask uh vineyard wind on,okay yeah i m not yeah i apologize you probably have to ask vinny dwayne about that okay that s,
um,i guess that s what my question was well certainly um all of the developers off the coast uh they we,but i guess that s to what my question was well certainly all of the developers off the coast you,
um,inaudible of impact study and and looking at spacing and um of of when turbines and we came up with a,going through this cumulative impact study and looking at spacing and of wind turbines and we came up with a,
um,be components that come out in in any decision for um vineyard wind that you d have to you know take,components that come out in any decision for when you d wind that you d have to you know take,
um,impact uh you know to other developers including us but um in terms of what might be in that or the,know you know to all the developers including us but in terms of what might be in that or the,
um,of what might be in that or the exact timing um i think uh vineyard might might have a better perspective,what might be in that or the exact timing i think vinyad might have a better perspective of that okay,
um,say on the uh first part of the question that um sort of obviously con ed has uh local knowledge of,guess i would say on the first part of the question and sort of obviously coned has local knowledge of,
um,and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that um that are valuable uh uh to any uh party if,and the network and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that are are valuable to any party if,
um,of the area that uh certainly we don t have um you know as as depth a knowledge as as they,and skill set of the area that certainly we don t have you know as depth of knowledge as they,
um,sets there that the local uh uh player would bring um so in terms of you know what the um components,certain skill set s there that the local player would bring so in terms of you know what the components,
um,bring um so in terms of you know what the um components of a relationship would be those things are all,would bring so in terms of you know what the components of a relationship would be those things are all,
um,as we as we move through but it s certainly um beneficial i think to the project to have uh somebody,to be discussed as we move through but it s certainly beneficial i think to the project and have somebody,
um,i think to the project to have uh somebody with um uh con ed s skill sets involved got it and,s certainly beneficial i think to the project and have somebody with kind of skill sets involved got it in,
um,there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop um not at this time no got it and then will,there any kind of thoughts on how that could develop not at this time no got it it and then,
um,the 300 to 400 million range that uh you expected um we haven t disclosed a uh range that we ve,day versus the 300 to 400 million range that you expected we haven t disclosed a range that we ve,
um,ve talked about how much we expected to to spend um you know this year you know you know um just,we ve expected we ve talked about how much we expected to spend you know this year you know just,
um,spend um you know this year you know you know um just for uh the year 2020 uh and it s,how much we expected to spend you know this year you know just for the year 2020 and it s,
um,uh under what we expected at at at this time um in terms of the financing uh you re right that,probably a little bit under what we expected at this time in terms of the financing you re right that,
um,3 of that so there s 700 million remaining that um and and i would say the same thing as i,of that so there s 700 million and i would say the same thing as i said all along as,
um,capital forecasts are and and what the market conditions are um you know as we look to um uh fulfill the,consider what our capital forecasts are and what the market conditions are you know as we look to fulfill the,
um,market conditions are um you know as we look to um uh fulfill the rest of that uh offering that we,and what the market conditions are you know as we look to fulfill the rest of that offering that we,

um,impact uh could be are you talking about the draft um information on on rates or what can you be more,order what the potential impact could are you talking about the draft information on rates or can you be more,
um,there was a draft decision on on monday in the um the pura case uh associated with uh with the rates,specific sure there was a draft decision on on monday in the uh the pera case associated with the rates,
um,the rates right the the rate review that was reversed um that proceeding i i uh uh i can tell you,the pera case associated with the rates right the rate review that was reversed that proceeding i can tell you,
um,uh i can tell you that the the specific name um no that s okay i you know i just wanted,was reversed that proceeding i can tell you that the specific name um no that s okay i just wanted,
um,that s okay i you know i just wanted to um i just wanted to be specific because as somebody else,you that the specific name um no that s okay i just wanted to be specific because as somebody else,
um,somebody else mentioned there s been a number of different um crosstalk sure so this um so as you recall we,somebody else mentioned has been a number of different yeah i know you re a lot so that s all,
um,been a number of different um crosstalk sure so this um so as you recall we uh that pura suspending the,been a number of different yeah i know you re a lot so that s all the pure suspenders the,
um,s kind of hot off the press we re apparently um evaluating that and um and and we re going to,order and really it s kind of hot off the press but currently evaluating that and we re going to,
um,off the press we re apparently um evaluating that and um and and we re going to you know see what,off the press but currently evaluating that and we re going to you know see what comments we might have,
um,we might have and comments on the draft are due um i thin it s the the 12th of november so,we might have and comment some of the draft could do i think it s the 12th of november so,
um,on first blush i d say it s consistent with um pura s desire to have uh some rate changes you,with on first blush i d say it s consistent with the purest desire to have some rate changes you,
um,in a shoulder month like as like may or something um and move to annual reconciliations as opposed to uh semi,shoulder a month like may or something and move to annual reconciliation as opposed to semi annual so this would,
um,as opposed to uh semi annual so this this would um you know it does it does delays this could have,annual reconciliation as opposed to semi annual so this would you know if there s delay it just could have,
um,it could have an impact on our our our deferrals um that that we have in place there but you know,item and it could have an impact on our on deferrals that we have in place there but you know,
um,peak periods for making rate changes and shoulder period and um see where we go from there but we re we,peak periods for making rate changes and see what we ve built in there so we re actively reviewing that,
um,have reviewed by as i said on the 12th okay um there there was one part of it that would reduce,they sit on the 12 okay there was one part of it that would reduce the carrying charges from wac,
um,part of it that would reduce the the carrying charges um from the uh from unk to a prime rate on,okay there was one part of it that would reduce the carrying charges from wac to a the prime rate,
um,to a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms um is there any um do we have any i know,the prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms is there any do we have any i know this is,
um,on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms um is there any um do we have any i know this is hot off,prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms is there any do we have any i know this is off,
um,we have any sort of forecast as to what the um those reconciliations mechanisms like how much capital might be tied,do we have any sort of forecast as to what those reconciliation mechanisms like how much capital might be tied,
um,in those uh no inaudible that is a point too um the uh um the carrying costs at at prime which,in those no that you did that is a point too the carrying cost at prime which is consistent in,
um,no inaudible that is a point too um the uh um the carrying costs at at prime which is consistent in,you did that is a point too the carrying cost at prime which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions,
um,is consistent in in some other jurisdictions i guess so um that it s not a significant um you know item,in some of the jurisdictions i guess so no it s not a significant you know item but it s,
um,i guess so um that it s not a significant um you know item but um it it s certainly one,of the jurisdictions i guess so no it s not a significant you know item but it s certainly one,
um,it s not a significant um you know item but um it it s certainly one that uh pura had put,guess so no it s not a significant you know item but it s certainly one that pure had put,
um,the deferred balances with uh with a prime prime rate um versus a a wack okay uh and then just um,in the draft is to recover the deferred balances with a prime rate versus a lack ok and then just,
um,um versus a a wack okay uh and then just um we we don t know who the president s gonna,with a prime rate versus a lack ok and then just we don t know who the president s going,
um,t know who the president s gonna be it seems um but if there was a change in administration um do,t know who the president s going to be it seems um but if there was a change in administration,

um,because i think it s a very important point that um bid bid bid is the best strategy our strategy is,because i think it s a very important point that big big big isn t that strategy our strategy is,
um,that benefit our shareholders so just by winning a bid um you know that doesn t do it it has to,returns that benefit our shareholders so just by winning a bid you know doesn t do it it has to,

um,win the bid and and and expand the business there um the what we ve said is we our tracks the,sense to make the bid win the bid and expand the business there what we ve said is our tracks,
um,not an an infinite uh growth type of thing and um we had indicated that uh when leases were available that,so it s not an intimate growth type of thing and we had indicated that when nieces were available that,
um,s a we re constrained by the lease area and um when our we re guided by the financial discipline too,mid atlantic etc so we re constrained by the lease area and we re guided by the financial discipline on,

um,reason for adoption great and the second question i know um with uh with the recent introduction of the apexmems family,the flexibility speed and delivery required by our customers in the recent introduction of our apex men s family of,
um,moving into the resonator market are you targeting select frequencies um you know where you know high volume frequencies with the,reason for adoption adoption market are you targeting select frequencies you know where you know high volume frequencies with the,
um,where you know high volume frequencies with the initial resonators um and i guess a related question you know since you,where you know high volume frequencies with the initial resonators and i guess a related question you know since you,
um,you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes um in those resonator structures thank you yeah yeah absolutely uh,silicon do you need new mask sets every time the frequency changes in those resonator structures yeah yeah absolutely we,
um,question first we do need uh a new mask set um but um sometimes uh those are very similar uh they,t answer the second question first we do need a new mask set but sometimes those are very similar the,

um,to as the team is is reworking that lid and um you know looking looking forward okay fair fair enough thanks,the team is reworking that and you know looking forward okay turn it off thanks thanks guys your next question,
um,good morning guys and uh great job on the quarter um i wanted to drill down a little bit more on,thank you good morning guys and great job on the quarter i wanted to drill down a little bit more,
um,re making i think you had some inventory constraints also um uh during the middle of the quarter and obviously inaudible,re making but i think you have some inventory constraints also um uh during the middle of the quarter um,
um,particularly light on and uh how you are thinking about um you know is there a favoring of a channel that,feeling particularly light on and how how you re thinking about you know are a favoring of a channel that,

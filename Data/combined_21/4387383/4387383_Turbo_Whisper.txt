 Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Clipper Realty 3Q20 earnings call.
 At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.
 It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Michael Friends.
 Sir, the floor is yours.
 Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for the third quarter 2020 Clipper Realty, Inc. Earnings Conference Call.

 sir. Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon and welcome to the third quarter of 2020 earnings
 call for the realty.
 I will provide an update on our business performance, including recent highlights and
 milestones, as well as how our company is responding to COVID-19 pandemic.
 I will then turn the call over to JJ
 who will discuss
 property level activities, including
 leasing performance and measures taken in line of the pandemic.
 Finally, Michael will speak about our quarterly financial performance.
 We will then take your questions.
 I will begin by thanking the entire Clipper team for their continued hard work and perseverance
 during this challenging period.
 their ongoing dedication
 to our residents, our communities
 and our business has been remarkable
 throughout the course of the pandemic and we are grateful for their efforts.
 Our properties have remained open and operational throughout the pandemic.
 We continue to take necessary steps to keep our tenants safe
 in compliance with state and local orders
 and are providing typical services to our residents.
 During the third quarter, we witnessed some pressure on occupancy and rental rates at
 several of our properties, driven by economic activity declines related to COVID-19.
 At quarter end, residential properties were 93% leased compared to 96% at the end of the second quarter.
 Despite the current headwinds, we are confident in the resiliency of New York City,
 and we expect our properties in the New York City market
 remain desirable to a broad range of
 standards and our operations to return to a normal rate state over time.
 Our balance sheet continues to be well-positioned from a liquidity perspective to manage through
 it through the pandemic.
 We have $105 million of cash consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and $22 million
 out of the restricted cash
 We finance our portfolio on an acid-by-acid basis,
 Death is non-recourse and is non-cross-collateralized.
 We have no debt maturities on any of our operating properties until 2027.
 During the third quarter, we purchased 45,858 shares of Commer stock at a weighted average
 price of $5.090 a share under our $10 million stock repurchase program announced in August.
 At the end of the quarter, we had $9.7 million remaining under the stock repurchase program.
 Turning to upcoming developments, we continue to proceed with the redevelopment of our Tantan
 Pacific Street Acquisition
 located in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
 about one mindful
 one mile from the Atlantic Terminal
 Barclays Center Huff.
 As previously disclosed, we estimated the project will cost approximately $85 million
 in total, and take two years to complete, and develop at a 6.5% stabilized cap rate.
 J.J. will provide further update on the project shortly.
 In our office portfolio, the new lease with the city of New York at 250 Livingston Street
 Commence in August.
 This lease is expected to initially add substantially, approximately $5. million to the property's
 annual of NOL and is
 to live as a significant amount of the company
 at one point one of the history of the city's red
 will increase twenty five percent at the end of the dot
 which will add $2.1 million to the property's annual NOI.
 Together, these roles are expected to add an incremental $7.1 million of annual annual
 to our portfolio, representing
 an approximate 10% increase
 on a normalized run rate.
 Out of Floppish Gardens' property, we are continuing with the uniform land use review procedure or ULIP-approved process with the city.
 We anticipate that approval would add significant floor area ratio to the complex, meaningful
 expanding the size of the properties
 adding significant value and allowing us to begin development.
 There is no insurance, however, that the application will fully or partially be approved or submitted.
 it.
 I'd like to provide an update to the Trebekah House 421G Kumbhsdisch Litigation.
 As previously discussed, the New York City Court of Appeals rules in June 2019,
 the department of the building is receiving
 421G tax benefits
 And that's subject to luxury deregulation.
 On October 29th, the appellate division applied the Court of Appeals ruling the Gina case holding
 as a base rent for the termination,
 and rent overcharges is four years prior to the 2016 filing of the Kumzic complaint.
 And overcharges, if any, are to be determined by comparing the rents actually charged during
 the four-year period
 to the rent increases permitted by New York City Rent Leveling Guidelines Board.
 Although not eliminating overcharge liability altogether, this ruling is expected to limit
 our financial exposure in this regard.
 The appellate division, however, affirmed the lower court's award of attorney's fees to
 the plaintiff's tenants.
 the case will potentially be
 remanded back to the lower court
 which will determine the amount of liability for rent over charges and attorney's fees.
 No future quotates have been scattered as of yet.
 We do not believe that this litigation will have a material impact on our business
 as it pertains to the limited subsets of previous and existing tenants at the property.
 The vast majority of current tenants and all future move-ins are not impacted by the litigation,
 as those units are free market.
 Lastly, I would like to comment on our third quarter results.
 We are reporting quarterly revenues of $29.6 million, NOI of $14.5 million, and an FFO of $2.9 million.
 Results that reflect the current headwinds discussed earlier.
 Michael will provide further details on our financial performance shortly.
 I will now turn the call over to JJ
 who will provide an up-to-date operation
 and our response to the pandemic
 including a targeted overhead reduction
 to future streamlined expenses.
 Thank you.
 again thanking our colleagues at our properties and corporate office for their tireless efforts
 throughout this challenging period.
 Their unwavering commitment to our tenants and communities has been inspiring.
 We faced certain revenue challenges in the third quarter as a result of declines in economic
 activity related to COVID-19.
 Third quarter total revenue was 3.6% lower than second quarter total revenue driven by
 declines in occupancy and rental rates at several of our properties due to the ongoing
 pandemic.

 Clifford and Rebecca were
 $66 at the end of the third quarter.
 we are working diligently to manage revenue at the property
 and note that occupancy has recently increased
 to 83%.
 Longer term, we believe that occupancy and rental rates at the property will return to
 pre-COVID levels given Trevecca House's attractiveness from a pricing standpoint
 compared to other luxury buildings in the surrounding neighborhood.
 The Flappish Gardens Complex in Brooklyn held up well in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint, as it has throughout the pandemic.

 rent per square foot was a record

 We continue to proactively streamline the business and manage our expense base
 and have reorganized certain operations at the property
 which is expected to result in annual cost savings in excess of $800,000.
 Dallas.
 Flappers Garns is a key element of our portfolio and growth story with the FAR expansion project and incremental value opportunity.
 The Clover House, Aspen, and 10 West 65th Street properties experienced some occupancy
 and pricing pressures
 due to COVID-19.
 each ending the third quarter approximately 90% least compared to
 mid-90 levels at the end of the second quarter. We have however
 seen a recent uptick in activity at these properties with occupancy gains ranging from
 380 to 610 basis points
 since the end of the quarter.
 Collections have remained strong during the pandemic.
 Our rent collection rate in the third quarter was 97%.
 We continue to work with tenants on a case-by-case basis
 when they notify us
 that they cannot meet their rent obligations
 as a result of the pandemic, including reviewing
 Potential Alternative Payment Arrangements.
 On the development side, we are completing the necessary regulatory process at 1010 Pacific
 Street to construct a nine-story
 119,000 rentable square foot
 fully amenitized multifamily rental building
 with underground indoor parking.
 The property will have 175 total units, 70% of which will be free market and 30% affordable
 and is eligible for a 35-year 421A tax abatement.
 We are in the process of negotiating a construction loan for the project.
 Looking ahead, we are focused on optimizing occupancy
 pricing and expenses across the business
 against the backdrop of ongoing pandemic-driven headwinds
 that continue to pressure both our portfolio and the New York City market in general.
 The near-term environment will remain challenging, but we are committed to strongly positioning
 ourselves to emerge from the pandemic.
 I will now turn over the call to Michael, who will discuss our financial results.
 Just one moment, gentlemen.
 And Michael's line has disconnected.
 We're reconnecting them now.
 Thank you.
 Nope.
 Thank you very much.
 Hello?
 Yes, this is the operator. We're trying to connect Michael Friends. His line has dropped.
 That's me.
 Come back.
 Oh, you're back. Okay, perfect. Thanks.
 Michael, you're on.
 All right.
 Thanks, guys.
 Apologies for that.
 I had a connection problem.
 Okay, for the third quarter, we achieved revenues of $29.6 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.6%, compared to the same period in 2019.
 We achieved NOI of $14.5 million and AFFO of $2.9 million, or $0.06 per share.
 The year-over-year total revenue increase was primarily attributable to the commencement
 of the new office lease
 at the 250 Livingston Street property
 and bringing the Gloverhouse property online during the third quarter of 2019.
 partially offset by a decline in leased occupancy and residential rental rate
 for Tribeca House property.
 On the expense side, key year-over-year changes were as follows.
 Property operating expenses increased by $0.5 million in the third quarter, year-on-year,
 primarily driven by an increase in the provision for bad debt due to the impact of COVID-19.
 real estate taxes and insurance
 increased by $0.7 million
 in the third quarter due to property tax increases across their portfolio
 and general insurance industry cost increases.
 Interest expense increased by $1.5 million in the third quarter year-on-year,
 primarily due to the recognition of interest expense
 in connection with bringing Cloverhouse online
 and the refinancing of the Flatbush Gardens property in May.
 As David mentioned earlier, we are well-positioned from a liquidity perspective.
 As of September 30th, we have $105 million of cash, consisting of $83 million of unrestricted cash and $22 million of restricted cash.
 We finance our portfolio on an asset-by-asset basis.
 our debt is non-recourse
 and is not cross-collateralized.
 We have no debt maturities on any operating properties until 2027.
 Lastly, today we are announcing a dividend of $0.095 per share for the third quarter, the same amount as last quarter.
 The dividend will be paid on November 27th to shareholders of record on November 20th.
 Let me now turn the call back over to David for concluding remarks.
 Thank you, Michael.
 we remain focused on efficiently
 operating our portfolio throughout the
 pandemic with the safety of our
 tenants and employees our highest priority.
 We continue to take the necessary steps to navigate through the current challenges,
 by strong balance sheets.
 New York City has survived and thrived through challenging circumstances over time.
 and we have every confidence that the city will merge from the pandemic as long as that.
 We basically look forward to capitalizing on a myriad of growth opportunities, including
 the 10-10 Pacific
 3-3
 the
 10-10 Pacific
 development and the potential expansion of Flappage Guns.
 We hope everyone stays safe and healthy.
 With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions.
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
 The floor is open for questions.
 If you have any questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one on your
 touch-tone phone. Pressing star

 please hold while we poll for questions
 And your first question is coming from Craig Kucera.
 Craig, your line's live.
 Yeah, hi. I just wanted to confirm, guys, did you say that outside of Tribeca, where you gave the update, that occupancy had improved to 83%?
 you mentioned Flatbush
 that all the other properties had seen anywhere from a 380 to 610 basis point in occupancy
 since the third quarter?
 Yes.
 Yeah. Hi, Craig. How are you?
 at the end of the
 second quarter some of the properties as we said aspen 10 west and clover house they were all in
 the mid 90s percent occupancy range 95 to 97 percent by the end of the third quarter they had
 dipped a bit to 90%.
 but since the end of the third quarter
 between September and today, we see a bump back up on those properties anywhere from
 three to four to five percent so the aspen ten west and clover house properties currently are
 East, ranging from
 92 to 95%.
 Okay, great.
 and
 I just wanted to follow up on
 And have rents trended basically flat then here in the fourth quarter
 or have there been any rent concessions to get those folks back?
 JJ, do you want to talk through that?
 Sure.
 so the rents have pretty much
 stayed
 a
 drop below what they were prior
 simply because we're trying to recapture occupancy
 so that we're well positioned for when the market does come back to start pushing rents again.
 So for now, we're doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartments.
 So there's a slight downtick in the rent per square foot because of that.
 Got it.
 And just one more for me.
 You know, are you tracking or able to track whether, you know, as the folks moved out from second to third quarter, are they are they staying in market or are these people that are basically just exiting the markets?
 maybe they'll come back at some point in the future
 but are no longer
 in the greater
 New York MSA
 to answer that
 again, without the exact
 The numbers, the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of the city.
 some of them depending on the property
 are moving to, let's say, second homes that they have in the suburbs.
 Many of them tell us when on the way out, they say, you know, we wish this didn't come to this.
 We hope to be back soon.
 we really like the
 you know
 the property and we're looking forward
 for when things get back to normal so we can return to the city.
 Okay, well, that's encouraging.
 That's it for me.
 Thanks, guys.
 If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one.
 You
 Okay, your next question is coming from Buck Horn.
 Talk to your lines live
 Yeah, hey, thanks.
 Hey, Mike, could you just quantify what the bad debt expense was in the quarter?
 I don't know if you broke, did you break that up?
 operating expenses
 Absolutely.
 as a refresher
 in the second quarter
 As you know, we took about a $600,000 bad debt expense and now into the third quarter here.
 Again, given the high collection rate, as JJ said, we're still in the high 90s.
 So what we've seen is actually, to date, pretty good and strong performance, even as the pandemic lingers.
 All in all, at the third quarter, we took a approximate $660,000 charge for bad debt.
 So about a 10% increase over the second quarter.
 But again, given everything that's been going on with the pandemic, I think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see collections hold up overall.
 Okay.
 If there are any remaining questions or comments, please indicate so now by pressing star one.
 Okay, we have no remaining questions in queue.
 thank you for joining us today
 We look forward to speaking with you again soon.
 Stay safe.
 Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
 This does conclude today's conference call.
 You may disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.
 Thank you for your participation.
 Thank you.
